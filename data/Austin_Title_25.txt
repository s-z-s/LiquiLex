Any person entitled to notice of a use determination under Section 25-1-133(B) (Notice of Applications and Administrative Decisions) may appeal the
decision to the Board of Adjustment no later than 14 days after notice is provided.
A request for a use determination that is not associated with a pending development application is a "non-project use determination" and is subject to
the requirements of this subsection.
A non-project use determination may be requested by anyone, at any time, for a use that requires a determination under Section 25-2-2 (Use
Determination).
In addition to the requirements in Subsection (C) of this section, an application for a non-project use determination must include:
any information requested by the director regarding the nature of the use for which a determination is requested, including the size, scale, or
intensity of the use; and
a specific address, if the applicant intends to rely on the determination in connection with a development application.
Within 14 days after receiving a request for a non-project use determination, the director shall provide notice of the determination:
to the applicant and to registered environmental and neighborhood organizations, if the determination is not associated with a specific address;
or
to all parties entitled to notice under Section 25-1-133(A) (Notice of Applications and Administrative Decisions), if the determination is associated
with a particular address.
Any person entitled to notice of a non-project use determination under this subsection may appeal the determination to the Board of Adjustment
within 14 days.
The director may not make a decision on an application that is dependent upon a use determination:
until after the period for appealing the use determination to the Board of Adjustment has run;
if the use determination is appealed to the Board of Adjustment, until after the board has decided the appeal; or
if a decision of the Board of Adjustment is appealed to district court, until after the district court has decided the appeal.
Unless a use determination is reversed or modified by the Board of Adjustment, the director shall follow the determination in reviewing subsequent
requests for a determination on the same or substantially similar land uses.
A use determination is not subject to further notification or appeal under this section if it has been considered by the Board of Adjustment in response to
an appeal or notice of the determination was previously provided under this section and no appeal was filed.
A use determination issued by the director under this section must:
include all information required under Section 25-1-133(C) (Notice of Applications and Administrative Decisions);
state the director's determination regarding how the use is classified under existing use regulations;
explain the factors considered by the director in making the determination under Section 25-2-2 (Determination of Use Classification), including the
similarity of a use to other classified land uses; and
describe any special characteristics of the use determination, including limitations on the size, scale, location or intensity, of the use.
A use determination issued under this section may not be used to render decisions interpreting site development regulations.

§ 25-1-542 - CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL.
The director shall review a Type 1 (Chapter 245) petition for vested rights under the criteria described in this subsection.
General Standard. A permit application is entitled to development rights under Chapter 245 of the Local Government Code if the permit is required to
initiate, continue, or complete a project for which a prior application was submitted to the City of Austin. An application is not entitled to development
rights if it is unrelated to or inconsistent with the original project or if the original project has been completed, changed, or expired.
Review Criteria. In determining whether a petition meets the standard for approval under this subsection, the director shall consider the following
factors:
The nature and extent of proposed development shown on the prior permit or other application that initiated the project for which vested rights
are claimed;
Whether the permit application submitted in connection with the vested rights petition is related to and consistent with the original project;
The nature and extent of prior development of the property, including any permitting or construction activity that occurred subsequent to the
vesting date requested by the applicant;
Any prior vested rights determinations made for development of the property; and
Whether the project has expired in accordance with Division 3 (Expirations) of this article or other applicable regulations.
The director shall review a Type 2 (Continuing Use) petition for vested rights under the criteria described in this subsection.
General Standard. A permit application is entitled to use rights under Section 43.002 of the Local Government Code to the extent that current
regulations would prohibit:
continuing to use the land in the manner in which it was being used on the date the annexation proceedings were instituted, if the land use was
legal at that time; or
beginning to use land in the manner that was planned before the 90 day before the effective date of the annexation if:
one or more licenses, certificates, permits, approvals, or other forms of authorization by a governmental entity were required by law for the
planned land use; and
a completed application for the initial authorization was filed with the governmental entity before the date the annexation proceedings were
instituted.
Review Criteria. In determining whether a petition meets the standard for approval under this subsection, the director shall consider the nature and
extent of development that:
occurred on the property prior to initiation of annexation proceedings, including photographs or other evidence substantiating the use; or
was proposed in one or more required applications submitted to a governmental entity.
Date of Annexation. For purposes of this subsection, annexation proceedings are deemed to have been instituted on the date of the first public
hearing before the city council on the annexation ordinance for the property.
The criteria in this section are intended to assist the director in reviewing Type 1 (Chapter 245) and Type 2 (Continuing Use) petitions for vested rights, but
do not limit the director from considering other factors relevant to the determination of rights for a particular project. The director may consider whether
a project is entitled to common law vested rights if the project is not subject to Chapter 245 or Section 43.002 of the Local Government Code.

§ 25-1-543 - EFFECT OF VESTED RIGHTS DETERMINATION.
If the director approves a vested rights petition, any permit required to initiate, continue, or complete the project shall be entitled to the development or
continuing use rights recognized by the vested rights determination, unless the project expires under Division 3 (Expirations) of this article or other applicable
regulations.

§ 25-1-544 - PROJECT CONSENT AGREEMENTS.
This section provides a voluntary mechanism for determining applicable regulations where the extent of a project's vested rights are unclear and for
incentivizing projects with clearly established vested rights to achieve greater compliance with current regulations.
An applicant may submit a request for a project consent agreement to the director, in writing, after the director issues a vested rights determination
under Section 25-1-541 (Vested Rights Determination) and before the application expires under Section 25-1-82 (Application Requirements and
Expiration). The request must identify:
current regulations for which compliance would be required, other than regulations exempt from vested rights protections under state law;
additional restrictions on the nature and intensity of the proposed development; and
any modifications or waivers requested as a condition to the agreement, including but not limited to provisions for the transfer or averaging of
impervious cover to include additional property or changes to the original project that increase compatibility with adjacent land uses.
The director may recommend a project consent agreement for approval to the city council if the director finds that the agreement achieves a greater
degree of environmental protection and compatibility with adjacent land uses than would occur if a project developed to the full extent of vested rights
that have been verified or are reasonably likely to exist for the project.
In making a determination under Subsection (C) of this section, the director shall consider:
the degree to which vested rights for the project have been established;
the importance of particular regulations to achieving adopted planning goals or policies for the area in which the project is located; and
a recommendation from the environmental officer regarding the environmental benefits of the proposed agreement, if vested rights from the
regulations of Chapter 25-8 (Environment) are asserted for the project.
The city council may consider approval of a project consent agreement under this section only if the agreement is recommended by the director or
initiated by the city council. Before the council acts on a consent agreement, the director shall seek a recommendation from the Environmental Board and
the Land Use Commission, and the council shall hold a public hearing. The director shall provide notice of the hearing under Section 25-1-132(B) (Notice
of Public Hearing).
In acting on a project consent agreement, the city council may approve, deny, or modify the agreement based on the standard applicable to the director's
review under Subsections (C) and (D) of this section. A project consent agreement may waive or modify site development regulations applicable to a
project as deemed appropriate by the city council.
A project consent agreement for a project located in the extraterritorial jurisdiction may include a development agreement as authorized under Section
212.172 of the Local Government Code. The director shall review a proposed development agreement concurrent with an application for a project
consent agreement, but council may consider the agreements separately or as a single agreement.
A project consent agreement is subject to the expiration requirements specified in this subsection.
A project consent agreement approved by the city council expires on the 90 day after approval, unless the applicant has submitted a complete site
plan application for review by the director under the terms of the agreement.
Following submittal of a site plan application, a project consent agreement expires if:
the site plan application expires under Section 25-1-82 (Application Requirements and Expiration); or
the site plan expires under Section 25-5-81 (Site Plan Expiration).
In approving a project consent agreement, the city council may extend the expiration periods established under this subsection.

§ 25-1-545 - ADMINISTRATIVE GUIDELINES.
The director may adopt guidelines to assist in reviewing applications under Section 25-1-533 (Vested Rights Petition Required), Section 25-1-544 (Project
Consent Agreements), and Section 25-1-553 (Managed Growth Agreements).
Guidelines adopted under this section for review of vested rights petitions may be used to help address common questions that arise in determining
vested rights, including but not limited to:
whether a permit application is required to continue, complete, or initiate the project for which vested rights are claimed;
whether the project for which vested rights are claimed has been completed, changed, or expired; and
whether progress towards completion of a project has been made under Section 25-1-554 (Dormant Projects).
Guidelines adopted under this section shall be posted on the department's website and made available to the public, but need not be adopted by
administrative rule under Section 1-2 (Adoption of Rules).

§ 25-1-551 - EXPIRATION REQUIREMENTS GENERALLY.
During the timeframes established under this division, a vested rights determination for a project approved under Section 25-1-541 (Vested Rights
Determination) applies to any permit application required to initiate, continue, or complete the project.
If the vesting date approved for a project under Section 25-1-541 (Vested Rights Determination) is based on a permit application that is submitted on or
after June 23, 2014, the project is subject to the expiration periods specified in Section 25-1-552 (Expiration of Projects Begun On or After June 23, 2014).
If all permits for a project expire, the project expires.
A permit application submitted after a project expires constitutes a new project and is subject to the current regulations of this title, except that:
if a site plan associated with a project remains active at the time the project expires, the vested rights determination for the project applies to any
application for a building permit necessary to complete construction of the site plan for as long as the site plan remains active; and
an application to extend a site plan associated with a project may be approved in accordance with Section 25-5-62 (Extensions of Released Site Plan by
Director).
The expiration of a project associated with a preliminary plan or a final plat does not affect the validity of a platted lot under this title.

§ 25-1-552 - EXPIRATION OF PROJECTS BEGUN ON OR AFTER JUNE 23, 2014.
The project expiration period established by this section applies if the vesting date approved for a project under Section 25-1-541 (Vested Rights
Determination) is based on a permit application that is submitted on or after June 23, 2014.
Except as provided in Subsection (C) of this section or in Section 25-1-551 (Expirations Generally), a project expires nine years after the vesting date
approved for the project under Section 25-1-541 (Vested Rights Determination).
If the vesting date approved for a project under Section 25-1-541 (Vested Rights Determination) is based on a fair notice application (new project)
submitted under Section 25-1-535 (Fair Notice Application):
the project expires one year after the date the application was submitted; or
if a permit application is submitted before the fair notice application expires, the project expires on the date applicable to the permit under this
section, except that the project expiration period shall be deemed to run from the date of the fair notice application.

§ 25-1-553 - MANAGED GROWTH AGREEMENTS.
This section provides a voluntary mechanism to request longer project expiration periods than those established under Section 25-1-552 (Expiration of
Projects Begun On or After June 23, 2014) for large-scale projects or projects located within a planned development center.
To be accepted for review, an application for a proposed managed growth agreement must include all information required by the director, including a
proposed expiration date, and must meet the requirements of this subsection.
An application for a managed growth agreement may be submitted concurrent with the first permit application, or before the review period expires, if
the project associated with the proposed agreement:
is filed for review under current regulations;
does not require a variance approved by the Land Use Commission or Board of Adjustment, unless the project is limited to residential uses that
do not require a site plan under Section 25-5-2 (Exemptions);
includes only property located within the zoning jurisdiction, outside of the Barton Springs Zone; and
includes at least 10 acres of land.
An application for a managed growth agreement may be submitted after approval of the first permit application, but no later than one year before
the project expires, if the project associated with the proposed agreement:
complies with the regulations in effect on the date the application for a managed growth agreement was submitted or, in extraordinary
circumstances, includes community benefits or superior development features that mitigate noncompliance with current regulations;
does not require a variance approved by the Land Use Commission or Board of Adjustment, unless the project is limited to residential uses that
do not require a site plan under Section 25-5-2 (Exemptions);
includes only property located within the zoning jurisdiction, outside of the Barton Springs Zone; and
does not impede or delay official City of Austin economic development or sustainability initiatives.
If an application meets the requirements in Subsection (B) of this section, the director shall:
schedule a public hearing on the proposed agreement and provide notice of the hearing under Section 25-1-132(B) (Notice of Public Hearing); and
make a recommendation to approve or deny the agreement based on whether the project:

is environmentally superior to the minimum standards applicable to the project under Chapter 25-8 (Environment), as determined based on a
recommendation from the environmental officer.
The city council may approve or deny a proposed managed growth agreement based on the criteria in Subsection (C) of this section and may establish
whatever expiration period the council deems appropriate, but may not waive or modify current regulations applicable to the project.
If a managed growth agreement is approved under this section, the director shall treat the project as vested to the regulations in effect on the date of the
first application until the date the agreement expires.

§ 25-1-554 - DORMANT PROJECTS.
This section is adopted under Section 245.005 of the Local Government Code to provide expiration dates for permits that lack an expiration date under
applicable regulations. This section does not apply to a permit that is subject to an expiration date under the regulations applicable to the permit. For
purposes of this section, a permit that is not subject to an expiration date is an "unexpired permit."
If an unexpired permit was approved prior to May 11, 2000, then the permit expired on May 11, 2004, unless the applicant submits evidence sufficient to
show that progress towards completion of the project was made under Subsection (D) of this section prior to May 11, 2000.
If an application for an unexpired permit was submitted after September 5, 2005, then the permit expires five years after the permit was approved unless
the applicant submits evidence sufficient to show that progress towards completion of the project was made prior to that date under Subsection (D) of
this section.
For purposes of this section, progress towards completion of a project includes any one of the following:
an application for a final plat or plan is submitted to a regulatory agency;
a good-faith attempt is made to file with a regulatory agency an application for a permit necessary to begin or continue towards completion of the
project;
costs have been incurred for developing the project including, without limitation, costs associated with roadway, utility, and other infrastructure
facilities designed to serve, in whole or in part, the project (but exclusive of land acquisition) in the aggregate amount of five percent of the most
recent appraised market value of the real property on which the project is located;
fiscal security is posted with a regulatory agency to ensure performance of an obligation required by the regulatory agency; or
utility connection fees or impact fees for the project have been paid to a regulatory agency.
If the first permit in a series of permits for a project expires based on dormancy of the project, then it cannot form the basis of a vested rights petition.

§ 25-1-601 - GENERAL PROVISIONS.
The City of Austin has determined that recreational areas in the form of public parks are necessary for the well-being of residents. The City has further
determined that the approval of new residential development is reasonably related to the need for additional parkland and park amenities to serve new
development. This article establishes the method for determining the amount of parkland dedication to be required as a condition to the approval of new
development.
Before receiving approval for a development application, an applicant shall provide for the parkland needs of the new residents.
Except as otherwise provided in this section, the parkland dedication requirements of this article apply to:

§ 25-1-602 - SINGLE-FAMILY DEDICATION OF PARKLAND.
For a development proposing single-family uses, parkland dedication will be satisfied by the dedication of suitable land for park and recreational
purposes in accordance with this section or by payment of a fee in-lieu of dedication under Section 25-1-606 (Single-Family Fee In Lieu of Parkland
Dedication).

In calculating the amount of parkland to be dedicated, the number of residents per unit is based on density as follows:
Density ClassificationResidents Per Unit
Low Density: Not more than 6 units per acre2.8
Medium Density: More than 6 and not more than 12 units per acre2.2
High Density: More than 12 units per acre1.7
If the density of a single-family development is not known:
the density is assumed to be the highest permitted in the zoning district, or if the property is not zoned, 24 dwelling units per acre; or
for a residential subdivision within the extraterritorial jurisdiction, the applicant may reduce the assumed density by agreeing, in a manner that is
enforceable by the City and approved by the city attorney, that any subsequent increases in density may require additional dedication of parkland
under this section or payment of a fee in lieu of dedication under Section 25-1-606 (Single-Family Fee In Lieu of Parkland Dedication).
The amount of parkland required to be dedicated within the Parkland Dedication Urban Core may not exceed 15% of gross site area for the development
required to provide the dedication except upon consent of the applicant or as authorized under this subsection.
The director may request that the Land Use Commission approve dedication greater than 15% off the gross site area, up to the amount required
under Subsection (B) of this section, if doing so is necessary to:
address a critical shortage of parkland for an area identified in the Deficient Parkland Area Map; or
provide connectivity with existing or planned parks or recreational amenities.
Before the Land Use Commission considers a request under this subsection for approval, the director shall present the request to the Parks Board for
a recommendation.
In considering a request from the director under this subsection, the Land Use Commission may:
deny the director's request and limit the required dedication to no more than 15% of gross site area; or
require additional parkland dedication greater than the 15% if gross site area, up to the lesser of:
the amount required under Subsection (B) of this section; or
the minimum amount the Land Use Commission finds to be necessary based on the criteria in Paragraph (l)(a)-(b) of this subsection and the
Parkland Dedication Operating Procedures.
If an applicant dedicates less than the amount of land required for dedication under Subsection (B) due to the cap imposed by this subsection, the
director shall require payment of a fee in-lieu of dedication under Section 25-1-606 (Single-Family Fee in Lieu of Parkland Dedication) for the
remaining undedicated land.

§ 25-1-603 - MULTI-FAMILY DEDICATION OF PARKLAND.
For a development application proposing multi-family uses, the director shall determine how the applicant will satisfy applicable parkland dedication
requirements. The director may require the applicant to:
dedicate land that meets the criteria in Section 25-1-604 (Standards for Dedicated Parkland) as parkland;
pay a parkland dedication fee under Section 25-1-608 (Multi-Family Parkland Dedication Fee); or
dedicate land that meets the criteria in Section 25-1-604 (Standards for Dedicated Parkland) as parkland and pay a reduced parkland dedication fee
calculated under Section 25-1-608 (Multi-Family Parkland Dedication Fee).
In determining how an applicant will satisfy their parkland dedication requirements under this article, the director shall consider whether the
development:
is located within the Deficient Park Area Map;
is adjacent to existing parkland;
has sufficient acreage to meet the standards for dedicated parkland under the Parkland Dedication Operating Procedures;
is needed to address a critical need for parkland or to remedy a deficiency identified by the Deficient Park Area Map; or
would provide increased connectivity with existing or planned parks or recreational amenities.

Subject to Subsection (D), if the director is requiring an applicant to satisfy their parkland dedication requirements entirely through land dedication, the
following formula will apply to determine the amount of land required:
[# of multifamily units × .005] + [# of hotel/motel rooms × .004] = Acres of parkland
The amount of land required to be dedicated may not exceed 10% of gross site area of the development.
If a development application proposes both multi-family and commercial uses, the amount of land dedication required is based on a prorated portion of
the land proposed for the multi-family use.

§ 25-1-604 - STANDARDS FOR DEDICATED PARKLAND.
In addition to the requirements of this article, land to be dedicated as parkland must meet the requirements of this subsection.
Parkland must be easily accessible to the public and open to public view so as to benefit area residents, enhance the visual character of the City,
protect public safety, and minimize conflicts with adjacent land uses.
On-street and off-street connections between residential neighborhoods shall be provided, wherever possible, to provide reasonable access to parks
and open space areas.
In addition to the requirements of this subsection, parkland must comply with the standards in the Comprehensive Plan, the Parks and Recreation
Long-Range Plan, the Environmental Criteria Manual, and the Parkland Dedication Operating Procedures.
If an applicant is proposing multifamily uses, the parkland shall not be encumbered with restrictions that will negatively impact the parkland's ability
to be used for recreational purposes with park amenities unless:
there is no feasible and prudent alternative land available for parkland dedication as determined by the director; and
the land will provide a critical greenbelt or trail connection with sufficient recreational opportunities.
The director shall determine whether land offered for dedication complies with the standards for dedication under Subsection (A) and may require a
subdivision or site plan applicant to provide information deemed necessary to determine compliance.
If an applicant is proposing single-family uses, then the director may allow land that does not otherwise meet the standards under Subsection (A) to be
dedicated as parkland if the land meets the requirements of this subsection.
50 percent of acreage in the 100-year floodplain that is dedicated as parkland may be credited toward fulfilling the requirements of this article if any
adjoining land within the 25-year floodplain is also dedicated as parkland. The land within the 25-year floodplain may not be credited toward fulfilling
the requirements of this article, unless it complies with Subdivision 25-l-604(C)(2).
Land identified on the Deficient Parkland Area Map may be accepted if the director determines that the land will provide recreational or educational
opportunities for the surrounding community. If the director determines the land has recreational or educational opportunities, 50 percent of the
acreage may be credited toward fulfilling the requirements of this article.
If land dedication is required for subdivision approval, the area to be dedicated must be shown on the preliminary plan and final plat as "Parkland
Dedicated to the City of Austin." The subdivider shall dedicate to the City all parkland required by this article when a plat is approved, except that the

§ 25-1-606 - SINGLE-FAMILY FEE IN LIEU OF PARKLAND DEDICATION.
For single-family development, the director may require or allow an applicant to deposit with the City a fee in lieu of parkland dedication under Section
25-1-602 (Single-Family Dedication of Parkland) if:
the director determines that payment of a fee in lieu of dedication is justified under the criteria in Subsection (B) of this section; and
the following additional requirements are met:
less than six acres is required to be dedicated under Section 25-1-602 (Single-Family Dedication of Parkland); or
the land available for dedication does not comply with the standards for dedication under Section 25-1-604 (Standards for Dedicated Parkland).
In determining whether to require dedication of land under Section 25-1-602 (Single-Family Dedication of Parkland) or allow payment of a fee in lieu of
dedication under this section, the director shall consider whether the subdivision or site plan:
is located within the Deficient Park Area Map;
is adjacent to existing parkland;
has sufficient acreage to meet the standards for dedicated parkland under the Parkland Dedication Operating Procedures;
is needed to address a critical need for parkland or to remedy a deficiency identified by the Deficient Park Area Map; or
would provide increased connectivity with existing or planned parks or recreational amenities.
The amount of the fee in lieu of parkland is established in the annual fee schedule based on a recommendation by the director in accordance with this
subsection.

§ 25-1-608 - MULTI-FAMILY PARKLAND DEDICATION FEE.
For purposes of determining the amount of a parkland dedication fee required for approval of a development permit proposing multi-family
development, City Council has designated all the land within its municipal boundaries into geographic areas via separate ordinance. These designations
may be modified as set out under state law.
The dwelling unit factor shall be:
.005 for multi-family units; and
.004 for rooms in a hotel or motel ordinarily used for sleeping.
The density factor shall be:
one for the suburban area;
four for the urban area; and
forty for the central business district area.
Every 10 years, the City will use the average land value for each geographic area calculated by the applicable appraisal district. For the years in which the
applicable appraisal district does not calculate the average land value, the City shall calculate the average land value for each geographic area by
multiplying the previous year's average land value for each geographic area by one plus the average CPI for each month of the previous year.
If the director has determined that an applicant will satisfy their parkland dedication requirements entirely by paying a parkland dedication fee, the dollar
amount required is calculated using the following formula:
{[(# of multifamily units) × .005] + [(# of hotel/motel rooms) × .004]} × (Avg Land Value of Geographic Area)/Density Factor
First, add the product of the number of multifamily units proposed to be developed by .005 and the product of the number of hotel and motel rooms
ordinarily used for sleeping proposed to be developed by .004.
Then, multiply the sum calculated under Subdivision (E)(1) by the average land value for the geographic area where the development is located.
Finally, divide the number calculated under Subdivision (E)(2) by the applicable density factor.
If the director has determined that an applicant is satisfying their parkland dedication requirements through dedicating land and paying a parkland
dedication fee, the dollar amount of parkland dedication fee owed is calculated using the following formula:
[Parkland dedication fee per Subsection (E)] - [(Applicable land value) × (# of acres)]
First, calculate the amount of fee using the formula described in Subsection (E).
Then, subtract the product of the land value applicable to the land and the number of acres dedicated from the total amount of the parkland
dedication fee.
If the applicant is dedicating land and paying a reduced fee, the applicant will only be required to dedicate for development approval an acreage amount
that has a land value that does not exceed the amount of parkland dedication fee calculated under this section. Additionally, the acreage amount shall
not exceed 10% of gross site area of the development.
If there is a remaining amount of parkland dedication fee after subtracting the land value of the acreage required to be dedicated as parkland, the
applicant may choose to construct recreational facilities on the future parkland in lieu of paying the remaining parkland dedication fee amount. The
recreational facilities must be shown on the subdivision or site plan application and constructed before the land is dedicated.

§ 25-1-609 - FEE PAYMENT AND EXPENDITURE.
Payment of a fee required under Section 25-1-606 (Single-Family Fee In Lieu of Parkland Dedication) or Section 25-1-607 (Single-Family Parkland
Development Fee) must be paid as required by this subsection.
If a fee in lieu of dedication or a parkland development fee is required as a condition to subdivision approval, the applicant must deposit the fee with
the City before final plat approval. The applicant may defer payment of a fee until site plan approval unless development proposed within the
subdivision is exempt from the requirement to submit a site plan under Section 25-5-2 (Site Plan Exemptions).
If a fee in lieu of dedication or a parkland development fee is required as a condition to site plan approval, the applicant must deposit the fee with the
City before the site plan may be approved.
Payment of a parkland dedication fee required under Section 25-1-608 (Multi-Family Parkland Dedication Fee) shall be paid prior to issuance of a
certificate of occupancy.
The director shall place fees paid under Section 25-1-607 (Single-Family Parkland Development Fee) into a separate fund than fees paid under Section 25-
1-606 (Single-Family Fee In Lieu of Parkland Dedication) and Section 25-1-608 (Multi-Family Parkland Dedication Fee). All fees collected shall be spent
consistent with the requirements of this subsection.

Except as provided in Subsection (C)(2), the director shall use fees paid under Section 25-1-606 (Single-Family Fee In Lieu of Parkland Dedication) and Section 25-1-
608 (Multi-Family Parkland Dedication Fee) solely to acquire land or easements for park purposes that will benefit residents of the development for which the fees
are assessed and are located within a service area designated by the director under the Parkland Dedication Operating Procedures.
The director may use fees paid under Section 25-1-606 (Single-Family Fee In Lieu of Parkland Dedication) and Section 25-1-608 (Multi-Family Parkland
Dedication Fee) and consistent with the purposes described in Subsection (C)(3) if, after one year from the date the fees are collected for expenditure,
the director determines that land which meets the requirements of Section 25-1-604 (Standards for Dedicated Parkland) is unavailable for purchase
within the service area for which the fees were assessed.
The director shall use fees paid under Section 25-1-606 (Single-Family Fee In Lieu of Parkland Dedication) to acquire and develop recreational
amenities that will benefit residents of the development for which the fees are assessed and are located within a service area designated by the
director under the Parkland Dedication Operating Procedures. If, after one year from the date the single-family parkland development fees are
collected for expenditure, the director determines there are no longer any parks within the service area for which fees were assessed that need new
recreational facilities, then the parkland development fees can be used to acquire land or easements for park purposes that will benefit residents of
the development for which the fees are assessed and are located within a service area designated by the director under the Parkland Dedication
Operating Procedures.
The City shall expend a fee collected under this article within five years from the date the fees are appropriated for expenditure by the director. This
period is extended by five years if, at the end of the initial five-year period, less than 50 percent of the residential units within a subdivision or site plan
have been constructed.
If the City does not expend a fee payment by the deadline required in Subsection (D), the subdivision or site plan applicant who paid the fee may request
a refund under the requirements of this subsection.
A refund may only be requested for unbuilt units for which a fee in lieu of dedication or parkland dedication fee was paid. The refund request must be
made in writing and filed with the Parks and Recreation Department not later than 180 days after the expiration of the deadline under Subsection (D).
If the refund request is timely filed, the director shall:
refund the amount of unspent fees that were collected under this article in connection with approval of a subdivision or site plan; and
if a site plan for which fees were assessed was subsequently revised to reduce the number of units, recalculate the amount due based on the
reduced number of units and refund any fees paid in excess of that amount.

§ 25-1-610 - PARKLAND DEDICATION DETERMINATION.
An applicant may make a written request to the director asking for a formal determination of the amount of parkland dedication that will be required to
obtain approval for a proposed development on their property.
After receiving a written request for a parkland dedication determination, the director may request additional information from the requestor. Any
additional information requested shall be:
public and readily available; and
necessary for the director to provide a parkland determination.
The director shall respond in writing to a request for a parkland dedication determination within 30 days after receiving a complete application.
Except as provided in Subsection (E), a parkland dedication determination issued under this section is valid for the property that is the subject of the
determination for a period that is the lesser of:
the time between the date of the determination is issued and the date a development application is filed that uses or relies on the determination; or
two years.
A requestor can void the applicability of a parkland dedication determination to their property by providing written notice to the director.

The director shall adopt a tenant relocation program by administrative rule for the purpose of mitigating the impacts of tenant displacement resulting
from multifamily redevelopment within the City of Austin.
The tenant relocation program must, at a minimum, include each of the elements described in this subsection.
Tenant Relocation Fee. The program must include a methodology to be used by the director in recommending to the city council the amount of the
fee required under Section 25-1-715 (Tenant Relocation Assistance—Developer Funded). The methodology shall include a nexus study that accounts
for the impacts of displacement to tenant communities directly affected by multifamily redevelopment and to the community as a whole. The fee shall
be consistently calculated and uniformly applied, but may vary based on number of units, bedrooms, and other objective criteria identified by the
nexus study.
Eligibility for Tenant Relocation Assistance. The program shall establish eligibility requirements that a tenant must meet in order to receive tenant
relocation assistance under Section 25-1-715 (Tenant Relocation Assistance—Developer Funded) or Section 25-1-716 (Tenant Relocation Assistance—
City Funded). At a minimum, the eligibility requirements must:
require that a tenant:
have a household income at or below 70% of median family income or, for residents of a mobile home park, 80% of median family income;
and
submit a claim form documenting income eligibility no later than the deadline established by the director; and
allow a tenant who resided at a property where multi-family redevelopment occurred if the tenant resided at the property:
for a multi-family property, 120 days before multi-family redevelopment begins; or
for a mobile home park, 270 days before multi-family redevelopment begins; and
prohibit participation by tenants of multi-family redevelopment that is exempt from this division under Section 25-1-711 (Purpose, Applicability,
Exemptions, and Definitions), except that the director may allow use of funds under Section 25-1-716 (Tenant Relocation Assistance—City Funded)
to provide relocation assistance for tenant displacement resulting from fire, civil commotion, malicious mischief, vandalism, natural disaster, or
other destruction beyond the control of the owner or tenant.
Use of Tenant Relocation Assistance. The program must specify the types of expenses for which tenant relocation assistance may be provided. Eligible
expenses paid using funds collected under Section 25-1-715 (Tenant Relocation Assistance—Developer Funded) must be reasonably attributable to
tenant displacement based on the nexus study required under Paragraph (C)(1).
Refund Procedures. The program shall establish procedures by which an applicant who paid a tenant relocation fee under Section 25-1-715 (Tenant
Relocation Assistance—Developer Funded) may request a refund of any fees not spent for an authorized purpose within ten years after approval of
an application for which notification is required under Section 25-1-712 (Tenant Notification Required).
The director may include additional elements in the tenant relocation program, including but not limited to notification forms and other documents
required under Section 25-1-712 (Tenant Notification Required) and Section 25-1-713 (Additional Notice Requirements).

Filing complaints. A person who meets the membership requirements described under Subsection (B) and believes that the neighborhood plan
contact team has violated the provisions of this section may file with the director a request to have the director investigate and mediate the
complaint. Such complaints shall be in writing and shall identify the neighborhood plan contact team alleged to be violating the provisions of this
section. All complaints must be filed within 45 days following the occurrence of an alleged violation.
Investigation. The director shall review with the charging party the allegations contained within the complaint and, if warranted based on the
requirements of this chapter, shall conduct a prompt and full investigation of the matter stated in the complaint through interviews with the charging
party, contact team officers, and through review of all available documentation. The director shall determine in writing whether dispute resolution is
warranted within 14 days of receiving a complaint and shall render a written report identifying issues to be addressed through dispute resolution
within 28 days of receiving the complaint.
Informal Dispute Resolution. If after investigation it is determined that there is reasonable cause to believe that dispute resolution is warranted, the
director shall endeavor to eliminate any such alleged violations by informal methods of conference, conciliation, and persuasion. All informal dispute
resolution and determinations of the director must be completed within 30 days after the director provides the written report.
Formal Dispute Resolution. If, after determining that there is reasonable cause to believe that dispute resolution is warranted, and the director is
unable to secure from the respondent an acceptable conciliation agreement, the director shall present a report to the Planning Commission within 30
days of completing the informal dispute resolution. If after review of the report the Planning Commission agrees with the report of the director, the
Planning Commission may recommend a more formal mediation or dispute resolution process. The Planning Commission shall set a deadline for the
completion of formal mediation based on the complexity and circumstances of a specific case and shall identify a neutral third party to conduct the
dispute resolution process.
Remedy.
In cases where the informal and formal dispute resolution processes initiated by the City are unable to secure from the respondent an acceptable
conciliation agreement, the Planning Commission may recommend that the director and the City discontinue recognition of the neighborhood
plan contact team under the provisions of this chapter until a conciliation agreement acceptable to the Planning Commission is reached.
In the event the City discontinues recognition of a neighborhood plan contact team, special designation of the organization as a neighborhood
plan contact team will be removed from the City of Austin Community Registry, the neighborhood plan contact team will no longer be granted the
authority to initiate Neighborhood Plan amendments, and the neighborhood plan contact team will no longer have access to any special
resources or authority through the City based on its status as a neighborhood plan contact team.
If recognition of a neighborhood plan contact team is discontinued for more than six months, the director may take action to initiate a new
neighborhood plan contact team for the planning area under the provisions of City Code Section 25-1-805(A)—(C). In the event that the director
takes action to initiate a new neighborhood plan contact team, the initial officers of the new neighborhood plan contact team may not have
served as officers of the previous neighborhood plan contact team at the time when recognition was discontinued.
Appeal. Charging parties and respondents may appeal the determination of the director and of the Planning Commission under this subsection to the
City Council. Actions that are appealable include the director's determination that dispute resolution is warranted; findings/determinations that come
out of the informal dispute resolution process; and discontinuation of recognition of a neighborhood plan contact team.

This division provides the procedures and minimum requirements for a planned unit development (PUD) zoning district to implement the goals of preserving the
natural environment, encouraging high quality development and innovative design, and ensuring adequate public facilities and services. The Council intends PUD
district zoning to produce development that achieves these goals to a greater degree than and that is therefore superior to development under conventional zoning
and subdivision regulations.
Source: Ord. 20080618-098.
§ 1.2. - COUNCIL AUTHORITY.
The council retains the legislative authority to determine whether PUD zoning is appropriate regardless of whether the proposed development meets the
standards prescribed by this division.

Zoning Department shall mail notice of the meeting to those entitled to receive notice of the project assessment report.
1.3.2.    Council Response.
The council or individual council members may supplement or respond to the recommendation of the director of the Neighborhood Planning and Zoning
Department with comments identifying issues that should or must be addressed during subsequent review and consideration of the application. A comment does
not obligate council members to vote for or against approval of the proposed PUD district zoning.
1.3.3.    Baseline for Determining Development Bonuses.
Unless the council establishes a different baseline as part of a comment under Section 1.3.2 (Council Response), the baseline for determining
development bonuses under Section 2.5 (Development Bonuses) is determined by:
the regulations of the base zoning district, combining district, and overlay district; and
any other applicable site development standards.
The director may recommend an alternate baseline for the property. Council may approve the director's recommendation or other baseline it
determines is appropriate.
Any bonuses granted under a combining district or overlay district may only be used to determine the baseline if the project complies with the
requirements for the bonuses and the bonuses can be achieved without violating any other applicable site development standards.

Development in a PUD may exceed the baseline established under Section 1.3.3 (Baseline for Determining Development Bonuses) for maximum height, maximum
floor area ratio, and maximum building coverage if:
the application for PUD zoning includes a report approved by the Director of the Neighborhood Housing and Community Development Department
establishing the prevailing level of affordability of housing in the vicinity of the PUD, expressed as a percentage of median family income in the Austin
metropolitan statistical area; and
the developer either:
for developments with residential units, provides contract commitments and performance guarantees that provide affordable housing meeting or
exceeding the requirements of Section 2.5.3 (Requirements for Rental Housing) and Section 2.5.4 (Requirements for Ownership Housing); or
for developments with no residential units, provides the amount established under Section 2.5.6 (In Lieu Donation) for each square foot of bonus
square footage above the baseline to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund to be used for producing or financing affordable housing, as determined
by the Director of the Neighborhood Housing and Community Development Department.
2.5.3.    Requirements for Rental Housing.
If rental housing units are included in a PUD, dwelling units equal to at least 10 percent of the bonus area square footage within the PUD must:
be affordable to a household whose income is 60 percent or below the median family income in the Austin metropolitan statistical area;
remain affordable for 40 years from the date a certificate of occupancy is issued; and
be eligible for federal housing choice vouchers.

Housing and Community Development Department.
2.5.5.    Alternative Affordable Housing Options.
A developer of a residential project may request an exception to the contract commitments and performance guarantees in Section 2.5.3 (Requirements for Rental
Housing) and Section 2.5.4 (Requirements for Ownership Housing) as follows:
Subject to approval by the Director of the Neighborhood Housing and Community Development Department, the developer may provide to the Austin
Housing Finance Corporation land within the PUD that is appropriate and sufficient to develop 20 percent of the residential habitable square footage
planned for the PUD; or
Subject to approval by the city council, the developer may provide all or a portion of the amount established under Section 2.5.6 (In Lieu Donation) for
each square foot of bonus square footage above baseline to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund to be used for producing or financing affordable
housing, as determined by the Director of the Neighborhood Housing and Community Development Department.
A request to pay a fee in lieu to meet all or a portion of the residential affordability requirement in Section 2.5.2.B must be submitted in writing to the
Director of Neighborhood Housing and Community Development Department, must include supporting documentation sufficient to demonstrate the

Regardless of whether a developer requests an exception under this section, the Director of Neighborhood Housing and Community Development
may recommend that a developer be allowed to pay a fee in lieu in order to comply with the contract commitments and performance guarantees in
Section 2.5.3 (Requirements for Rental Housing) and Section 2.5.4 (Requirements for Ownership Housing). The recommendation must be in writing,
supported by the Director's reasons as to why the fee in lieu option is appropriate, and approved by city council to be effective.
Council approval of any alternative affordable housing project shall expire 36 months after the date of approval if the project has not been initiated.
2.5.6.    In Lieu Donation.

Except as provided in Subsection (E), the council may designate an area a creative spaces district if:
the area is at least three acres;
the base zoning for each site within the area is a commercial or less restrictive base zoning district;
at least 25 percent of the primary uses within the proposed district are existing creative spaces or are proposed to be used as creative spaces; and
at least 50 percent of the existing uses are non-residential.
The council may enlarge an existing creative spaces district if the site to be included contains uses that qualify as existing creative spaces or is proposed
to contain new creative spaces and the creative spaces add or will add value to the district.
Except as provided in Subsection (E), the council may reduce the boundary of an existing creative spaces district if the site to be excluded:
does not contribute to the preservation or creation of creative space, including affordable creative space;
does not include a creative space; and
has not utilized the benefits of the density bonus program.
Limitations.
A site within a creative spaces district is not eligible to be combined with any other density bonus combining district.

§ 25-2-473 - VARIANCE REQUIREMENTS.
A variance from the requirements of this chapter, or a Neighborhood Conservation Combining District adopted under this chapter, may be granted under
this division if, because of special circumstances of a property, the strict application of this chapter deprives the property owner of privileges that are

the requirement does not allow for a reasonable use of property;
the hardship for which the variance is requested is unique to the property and is not generally characteristic of the area in which the property is
located; and
development under the variance does not:
alter the character of the area adjacent to the property;
impair the use of adjacent property that is developed in compliance with the City requirements; or
impair the purposes of the regulations of the zoning district in which the property is located.
The Board may grant a variance from a loading facility or off-street parking design requirements if, in addition to the findings required by Subsection (A),
the Board determines that:
current or anticipated traffic volume generated by the use of the property or a nearby property does not reasonably require strict compliance with
and enforcement of the requirement from which a variance is requested;

§ 25-2-476 - SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS.
The Board of Adjustment shall grant a special exception for an existing residential structure, or portion of an existing structure, that violates a setback
required under Chapter 25-2 (Zoning) if the board finds that the special exception meets the requirements of this section.
The Board shall grant a special exception under Subsection (A) of this section if:

the Board finds that:
the violation has existed for:
at least 25 years; or
at least 10 years, if the application for a special exception is submitted on or before June 6, 2017;
the use is a permitted use or a nonconforming use;
the structure does not share a lot with more than one other primary residence; and
granting a special exception would not:
alter the character of the area;
impair the use of adjacent property that is developed in compliance with city code; or
grant a special privilege that is inconsistent with other properties in the area or in the district in which the property is located.
A special exception granted under this section:
applies only to the structure, or portion of a structure, for which the special exception was granted and does not run with the land;

the topography and other natural features;
the use of the structure; and
the evacuation capability of the occupants;
the structure incorporates a system for the early detection and notification of a pipeline leak, if the fire chief determines that an appropriate system is
commercially available; and
the performance-based design for occupant evacuation and the early detection and notification system are certified and sealed by an engineer
registered in Texas.
A person may not build new construction within 200 feet of a hazardous pipeline unless:
the fire chief determines that:
the new construction has a performance-based design that provides a minimum one-hour time period for occupant evacuation to a safe place in
the event of a pipeline leak or a fire associated with the pipeline, in accordance with Chapter 25-12, Article 7 (Uniform Fire Code) or the 2000
edition of the National Fire Protection Association 101 Life Safety Code;
the new construction incorporates a system for the early detection and notification of a pipeline leak, if the fire chief determines that an
appropriate system is commercially available; and
the performance-based design for occupant evacuation and the early detection and notification system are certified and sealed by an engineer
registered in Texas; or
the new construction complies with the standards for construction near a pipeline prescribed by the Fire Criteria Manual.

an additional one square foot of gross floor area is permitted for each one square foot of a parking structure that is below grade.
Additional gross floor area is permitted for each existing Category A tree, as determined by the Watershed Protection and Development Review
Department's tree evaluation system, that is either left undisturbed or transplanted under the supervision of the city arborist.
A tree is considered undisturbed under this subsection if the area within a circle centered on the trunk with a circumference equal to the largest
horizontal circumference of the tree's crown is undisturbed.
A tree may be transplanted off-site if the Land Use Commission determines that the character of the site is preserved and approves the transplanting.
The permitted additional gross floor area is calculated by multiplying the undisturbed area described in Subsection (E)(1) by the base district height
limitation and dividing the product by 12.
Additional gross floor area is permitted for land or an easement dedicated to the City for public access to Town Lake or the Colorado River. The additional
gross floor area is calculated by multiplying the square footage of the access area by the height limitation applicable to the property and dividing the
product by 12.
Additional gross floor area is permitted for land that is restricted to create a side yard or restricted public access to Town Lake, the Colorado River, or a
creek. The additional gross floor area is calculated by multiplying the square footage of the restricted area by the height limitation applicable to the

In the outer west campus subdistrict, local uses are not permitted in a residential base district unless the property:
has a permitted building height of 50 feet or greater; or
is zoned historic and has a permitted building height of 65 feet or greater.
Except as provided in Paragraph (3), up to 20 percent of the gross floor area of a site may be used for local uses. At least one-half of the gross floor
area of the local uses must be located at street level and accessible from a pedestrian path. In determining these percentages, a nonresidential use
that is accessory to the principal residential use or located in a historic landmark is excluded from the gross floor area of the local uses.
Up to 100 percent of the gross floor area of a structure may be used for local uses if the structure:
is a historic landmark and is located entirely in a subdistrict having a permitted building height of 65 feet or greater;
was constructed before September 13, 2004, contains less than 10,000 square feet of gross floor area, is less than 65 feet in height, and is located

calculated by determining the cumulative length of the building at ground level adjacent to each street other than an alley, and then deducting the
cumulative length of driveways, exit stairs, elevators, and utility equipment space.
For a site with frontage on more than one street, driveways, exit stairs and elevators must be located on a street that runs north and south, unless the
director of the Neighborhood Planning and Zoning Department determines that those features cannot reasonably be located along that street
because of topographical conditions.
The ground floor of a building may not be more than five feet higher or lower than an adjacent public street sidewalk. This does not apply to the

§ 25-2-766.02 - TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT CLASSIFICATIONS DESCRIBED.
A transit oriented development (TOD) district is classified according to its location, as described below.
A neighborhood center TOD district is located at the commercial center of a neighborhood. The average density is approximately 15 to 25 dwelling units
for each acre. Typical building height is one to six stories. Uses include small lot single-family residential use, single-family residential use with an
accessory dwelling unit, townhouse residential use, low-rise condominium residential use and multifamily residential use, neighborhood retail and office
uses, and mixed-use buildings.
A town center TOD district is located at a major commercial, employment, or civic center. The average density is approximately 25 to 50 dwelling units for
each acre. Typical building height is two to eight stories. Uses include townhouse residential use, low- and mid-rise condominium residential use and
multifamily residential use, retail and office uses, and mixed-use buildings.
A regional center TOD district is located at the juncture of regional transportation lines or at a major commuter or employment center. The average
density is more than 50 dwelling units for each acre. Typical building height is three to ten stories. Uses include mid-rise condominium residential use and
multifamily residential use, major retail and office uses, and mixed-use buildings.
A downtown TOD district is located in a highly urbanized area. The average density is more than 75 dwelling units for each acre. Typical building height is
six stories or more. Uses include mid- and high-rise condominium residential use and multifamily residential use, large retail and office uses, and mixed
use buildings.

§ 25-2-766.03 - TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT ZONES DESCRIBED.
A transit oriented development (TOD) district may be divided into zones of varying development intensity, as described in this section.
A gateway zone is the area immediately surrounding the station platform, where passengers enter or exit transit vehicles. Typically, this area includes
land that is about 300 to 500 feet from the edge of the station platform. This zone has a high level of transit integration, including streetscapes that
connect the station platform with the surrounding buildings, and buildings that are oriented toward the station platform and provide ground floor
pedestrian-oriented uses and employment or residential uses in the upper floors. A gateway zone has the highest density and building height in a TOD
district.
A midway zone is the area between a gateway zone and a transition zone, beginning at the outer boundary of the gateway zone and ending
approximately 1,000 to 1,500 feet from the edge of the station platform. This zone is predominately residential, but it may also contain retail and office
uses. The zone includes a variety of building types. A midway zone has density and building height that are lower than a gateway zone but higher than a
transition zone.
A transition zone is the area at the periphery of the TOD district. Development intensity is compatible with the existing or anticipated future development
adjacent to the TOD district. A transition zone has the lowest density and building height in a TOD district.

A Group "B" nonconforming use must comply with the regulations described in this subsection.
A person may continue a nonconforming use and maintain an associated structure, except the person may not:
increase the floor space or site area of a nonresidential use; or
make a change that increases the amount of required accessible spaces.
A person may improve, enlarge, or structurally alter a structure if the cost does not exceed 20 percent of the value of the structure before the
improvement.
An improvement required by law to meet minimum health and safety requirements, or an improvement to a portion of a structure used solely for a
conforming use may not be used in determining valuations under Subsection (B).
A Group "C" nonconforming use must comply with the regulations described in this subsection.
A person may continue a nonconforming use and maintain an associated structure.
A person may expand the portion of a structure or site that is used for a nonconforming use, except:
an expansion of the portion of the site must be on the same lot and may occur only one time; and
an expansion may not increase the amount of off-street parking that was required prior to November 13, 2023, to more than 120 percent of that
required for the use on the later of March 1, 1984 or the date the use became nonconforming.
If a structure is used for a nonconforming conditional use that the Land Use Commission has not approved, a person may annually expend not more
than 20 percent of the value of the structure to improve, enlarge, or structurally alter the structure.
A Group "D" nonconforming use must comply with the regulations described in this subsection.
A Group "D" nonconforming use must comply with Group "C" nonconforming use regulations.
A nonconforming conditional use approved by the Land Use Commission may be replaced by a similar nonconforming conditional use if the Land Use
Commission:
reviews traffic generation, noise, hours of operation, number of employees, and other appropriate performance measures;
determines that the replacement use will not more adversely affect surrounding uses than does the original use; and
approves the replacement use.

SUBCHAPTER E: - DESIGN STANDARDS AND MIXED USE.
Editor's note:
Background: On February 26, 2004, the Austin City Council directed the City Manager by resolution "... to prepare recommendations for citywide design
standards for commercial and retail development. These recommended citywide design standards shall constitute the best practices of the standards adopted by
communities around the nation and shall require design standards that reflect Austin's unique historic, landscape and architectural character..."
In order to implement the Council's direction, a specially appointed Task Force met over several months to consider research and input from the public, various
stakeholder groups, and individuals. The Task Force sought to understand the preferences of Austin citizens and the design regulations of other cities prior to
developing a recommendation.
The Task Force produced, and in May 2005 the City Council adopted, a policy report entitled "Raising the Design Standards in Austin, Texas." The Task Force
report identified a number of areas where regulatory improvements are necessary in order to raise the bar of development quality in Austin. The general intent was
to develop regulations that will foster a built environment of aesthetic and sustainable value, enhance economic development efforts, promote Austin's unique
character and natural environment, and ensure an efficient development review process.
The proposals for new standards were intended to raise the level of quality for all non-residential and mixed-use development, but within a regulatory structure
offering options and flexibility, not strict requirements. New development would be subject to a set of minimum site and building design standards, recognizing that
all new development, regardless of size, should be subject to minimum standards. The following topics were addressed in the Task Force report: Development
orientation; Parking; Land use; Signs; Stormwater management; Connectivity; Exterior lighting; Screening and compatibility; and Building design.
12/4/25, 4:54 PMAustin, TX Land Development Code

In each of these topic areas, the Task Force report discussed the key issue generally and proposed regulatory language to address the issue. In a few areas,
specific ordinance language was proposed, but in most areas the proposed language recommended general approaches rather than actual ordinance language. In
some areas, the proposed new standards would be new for Austin, while in other areas the proposed standards would require amendments to the Austin Code.
This Subchapter is intended to implement the Task Force report by establishing a clear, user-friendly, and legally enforceable ordinance that will result in
improved development quality in Austin. This Subchapter is officially known as Subchapter E of Chapter 25-2 of the City Code. This Subchapter was adopted on
August 31, 2006, and will become effective on January 13, 2007. The Task Force recommends reviewing this Subchapter once it has been in place for one year.
How to use this Subchapter:
Applicability is Based on Adjacent Roadway and Type of Development: This Subchapter recognizes that development should reflect and respond to its location
within the city. For example, a commercial development in a suburban location can (and often should) look and function differently than a commercial development
in downtown Austin. Because roadways provide both access to a site and define the urban design framework of the city, roadway types have been used as an
organizing tool to establish many of the new development standards in this Subchapter. This approach is intended to help ensure a cohesive development pattern
along Austin's streets and remove some of the inconsistency that arises from having a variety of zoning districts fronting a single roadway.
Because many of the standards in this Subchapter are defined based on roadway type(s) near the property, an important first step in the development process is
to determine the roadway types that are adjacent to a site. The size of the site and the type of development (residential, commercial, mixed use, etc.) also need to
be considered, since different standards may apply. The applicability chart in Article 1 summarizes the applicability of all the standards in this Subchapter, based on
type of adjacent roadways and development activity.
The following different types of roadways are identified in this Subchapter:
Core Transit Corridors include roadways that have or will have a sufficient population density, mix of uses, and transit facilities to encourage and support transit
use. Existing Core Transit Corridors have been designated and are defined in Article 5 and shown on Figure 1. Examples include South Congress Avenue (north of
Stassney Lane) and Anderson Lane (between Burnet Road and Mopac). Additional Core Transit Corridors may be designated in the future through neighborhood
planning processes.
Hill Country Roadways are those roadways identified in Section 25-2-1103, such as RM 2222 and Southwest Parkway. Standards in this Subchapter that reference
the Hill County Roadway designation apply to all properties within 1000 feet of these roadways.
Highways include all freeways, parkways, expressways, and frontage roads identified in the Austin Area Metropolitan Transportation Plan, except for Core Transit
Corridors.
Internal Circulation Routes are public streets or private drives edged by a curb within a development.
Suburban Roadways are roads outside the Urban Roadway Boundary, defined below and shown on Figure 2, that are not Core Transit, Hill Country, or Highway
Roadways.
Urban Roadways are roads other than those designated as Core Transit Corridors and Highways located within the following boundaries, as shown on Figure 2:
183 from Burnet to Hwy 71

How this Subchapter is organized:
This Subchapter is divided into five Articles.
Article 1 includes General Provisions that should be reviewed for all development and redevelopment projects. Most importantly, a chart summarizes the
applicability of the various standards based on roadway types and development types.
To allow flexibility in administering this Subchapter, this Article includes a "minor modification" provision that allows for City staff to approve small deviations
from otherwise applicable standards in order to protect natural or historic features or to address unique site conditions.
The Article also encourages creativity and innovative design by allowing an applicant to propose an alternative approach to meeting the standards of the
Subchapter through the "alternative equivalent compliance" provision.
Article 2 includes Site Development Standards intended to ensure that buildings relate appropriately to surrounding developments and streets, promote efficient
pedestrian and vehicle circulation, and provide parking in safe and appropriate locations, while creating a unique and identifiable image for development in Austin.
In particular, standards in this Article address the following:
Relationship of buildings to streets and walkways (based on roadway type);
Connectivity (based on roadway type);
Exterior lighting;
Screening of equipment and utilities; and
Private common open space and pedestrian amenities.
Article 3 includes Building Design Standards intended to address the physical appearance of buildings subject to this Subchapter. Included are:
General requirements for glazing and shading to ensure that building façades are pedestrian-friendly; and
Additional options to improve building design. An applicant may choose which of these options to meet from a flexible, point-based menu. All buildings
subject to this section must reach a minimum number of points, with additional points required for certain building types (e.g., buildings with
trademarked design features, large buildings or long façades, and buildings using a large percentage of certain building materials.)

Article 4 includes standards and incentives for Mixed Use development. This Article includes descriptions and standards for the Mixed Use Combining District and
the Vertical Mixed Use Overlay District. This Article also includes standards and incentives for the development of Vertical Mixed Use (VMU) buildings.
Article 5 includes Definitions for terms used in this Subchapter.

ARTICLE 1: - GENERAL PROVISIONS.
§ 1.1. - GENERAL INTENT.
This Subchapter generally addresses the physical relationship between commercial and other nonresidential development and adjacent properties,
public streets, neighborhoods, and the natural environment, in order to implement the City Council's vision for a more attractive, efficient, and livable
community. The general purposes of this Subchapter include:
1.1.1.
To provide appropriate standards to ensure a high quality appearance for Austin and promote pedestrian-friendly design while also allowing flexibility, individuality,
creativity, and artistic expression;
1.1.2.
To strengthen and protect the image, identity, and unique character of Austin and thereby to enhance its business economy;
1.1.3.
To protect and enhance residential neighborhoods, commercial districts, and other areas by encouraging physical development that is of high quality and is
compatible with the character, scale, and function of its surrounding area;
1.1.4.
To encourage developments that relate well to adjoining public streets, open spaces, and neighborhoods; and
1.1.5.
To provide for and encourage development and redevelopment that contains a compatible mix of residential and nonresidential uses within close proximity to each
other, rather than separating uses.

§ 1.4. - MINOR MODIFICATIONS.
1.4.1.    Purpose and Scope.
"Minor modifications" are small deviations from otherwise applicable standards of this Subchapter that may be approved by the Director in order to protect natural
or historic features or to address unusual site conditions. Minor modifications are to be used when the limited nature of the modification requested, and the
unlikelihood of any adverse effects on nearby properties or the neighborhood, make it unnecessary to complete a formal variance process.
1.4.2.    Applicability.
The Director may approve minor modifications of any numeric development standard in this Subchapter up to a maximum of ten percent (or up to a maximum of
20 percent to protect an existing natural site feature), provided that the applicable criteria in Section 1.4.4 (Approval Criteria) are met.
For a Heritage Tree, the Director may approve modification of any numeric development standard in this Subchapter to the minimum extent required to preserve
the Heritage Tree.
A modified development standard is calculated by applying the percentage of modification allowed by the Director to the numeric requirement that would
otherwise apply if the development standard was not modified. For example, if a building façade is required to have 40% glazing, which would equal 400 square feet
glazing on a 1000-square foot façade, then a 10% minor modification would decrease the amount of required glazing by 40 square feet for a total of 360 square feet
of required glazing. The minor modification process may be used only to authorize a less restrictive standard and may not be used to impose a standard on the
subject property than is higher than otherwise provided in this Subchapter. In no circumstance shall the Director approve a minor modification that results in:
An increase in overall project intensity, density, or impervious cover;
A change in permitted uses or mix of uses;
A change in the requirements of any of the following provisions:
Subchapter C, Article 3 (Additional Requirements for Certain Districts);
Subchapter C, Article 4 (Additional Requirements for Certain Uses);
Subchapter C, Article 10 (Compatibility Standards); or
A change in conditions attached to a subdivision plan, site plan, special use permit, or restrictive covenant approved by the City.
1.4.3.    Procedure.
The Director may initiate or approve a minor modification allowed under this section at any time prior to submittal of the staff report on the application to another
decision-making body or prior to final decision if the Director is the final decision-maker. The Director shall specify any approved minor modifications and the
justifications for such modifications on the pending development application for which the modifications were sought.
1.4.4.    Approval Criteria.
The Director may approve a minor modification from the terms of this Subchapter only upon finding that the modification meets all of the criteria below:
The requested modification is in general conformity with the stated purposes of this Subchapter;
The requested modification meets all other applicable zoning, building, drainage, water quality, and safety code requirements;
The requested modification will have no significant adverse impact on the health, safety, or general welfare of surrounding property owners or the
general public, or such impacts will be substantially mitigated; and
The requested modification is necessary to compensate for some practical difficulty or some unusual aspect of the site of the proposed development
not shared by landowners in general.

To encourage creative and original design, and to accommodate projects where the particular site conditions or the proposed use prevent strict compliance with
this Subchapter, alternative equivalent compliance allows development to occur in a manner that meets the intent of this Subchapter, yet through an alternative
design that does not strictly adhere to the Subchapter's standards. The procedure is not a general waiver of regulations. Alternative equivalent compliance shall not
be used when the desired departure from the standards of this Subchapter could be achieved using the minor modification process in Section 1.4.
1.5.2.    Applicability.
The alternative equivalent compliance procedure shall be available only for the following sections of this Subchapter:
Section 2.2, Relationship of Buildings to Streets and Walkways;
Section 2.3, Connectivity Between Sites;
Section 2.5, Exterior Lighting;
Section 2.7, Private Common Open Space and Pedestrian Amenities;
Section 2.8, Shade and Shelter; and
Article 3, Building Design Standards.
1.5.3.    Procedure.
The applicant may select at his or her discretion whether to seek an informal recommendation or a formal approval on a proposal for alternative compliance.
Option One: Informal Recommendation.
Pre-Application Conference Required. If an applicant desires only an informal response and recommendation as to a proposal for alternative
compliance, he or she shall request and attend a pre-application conference prior to submitting the site plan and/or building permit application
for the development. At the conference, the applicant shall provide a written summary of the project and the proposed alternative compliance,
and the Director shall offer an informal, non-binding response and recommendation regarding the appropriateness of the proposed alternative.
Based on that response, the applicant may prepare a site plan and/or building permit application that proposes alternative compliance, and such
application shall include sufficient explanation and justification, in both written and graphic form, for the alternative compliance requested.
Decision-Making Responsibility. Final approval of any alternative compliance proposed under this section shall be the responsibility of the
decision-making body responsible for deciding upon the application. The final decision-making body for site plans is either the Director or the
appropriate Land Use Commission, as specified in Chapter 25-5, and the building official for building permits.
Decision by Director. If an Alternative Equivalent Compliance proposal is submitted under this subsection the Director shall review the concept
plan for compliance with the criteria in Section 1.5.4. and shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the concept plan in writing.
Option Two: Formal Decision.
Pre-Application Conference. If an applicant desires formal approval of a proposal for alternative compliance, he or she shall request and attend a
pre-application conference prior to submitting the site plan and/or building permit application for the development.
Alternative Compliance Concept Plan Required. At least ten days prior to the pre-application conference, the applicant shall submit an
alternative compliance concept plan application to the Director, which shall include:
A written description of and justification for the proposed alternative method of compliance, specifically addressing the criteria in Section
1.5.4.; and
A concept plan that describes and illustrates, in written and graphic format, the intended locations and quantities of proposed buildings on
the site, the layout of proposed vehicle and pedestrian access and circulation systems, and areas designated to meet requirements for open
space, parking, on-site amenities, utilities, and landscape. The concept plan shall describe the site's topography and shall provide a general
description of environmental characteristics to assist in determining compliance with this Subchapter. If alternative compliance is requested
from the standards of Article 3, Building Design, the concept plan also shall include descriptions and illustrations of the proposed building
design elements that would not comply with the standards of this Subchapter.
Decision by Director. If an Alternative Equivalent Compliance proposal is submitted under this subsection the Director shall review the concept
plan for compliance with the criteria in Section 1.5.4. and shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the concept plan in writing.
Expiration of Alternative Compliance Concept Plans.
An approved alternative compliance concept plan shall expire if three years pass following its approval and no building permit that
implements the concept plan has been issued.
One, one-year extension may be issued by the Director provided that a written request has been received prior to the expiration of the
concept plan, and the Director has determined that no major changes in the city's development standards, or changes in the development
pattern of the surrounding properties, have occurred.
Effect of Approval. Written approval of an alternative compliance concept plan does not authorize any development activity, but rather authorizes
the applicant to prepare a site plan and/or building permit application that incorporates the approved alternative compliance, and authorizes the
decision-making body (either the Land Use Commission or the Director for site plans, and the building official for building permits) to review the

site plan and/or building permit application for compliance with the alternative compliance concept plan, in addition to all other applicable requirements. The site
plan and/or building permit application shall include a copy of the approved alternative compliance concept plan.
Amendments to Alternative Compliance Concept Plans.
Minor amendments to any approved alternative compliance concept plan may be approved, approved with conditions, or denied
administratively by the Director. For purposes of this provision, minor amendments are those that do not result in:
An increase of 10 percent or more in the amount of square footage of a land use or structure;
A change in the types of uses in the project;
An increase or decrease of 20 percent or more in the number of dwelling units in the project; or
A change that would bring the project out of compliance with any requirement or regulation set forth in the City Code outside this
Subchapter unless a variance to or waiver from such requirement or regulation is obtained.
Amendments that are not determined by the Director to be minor amendments under subsection a. above shall be deemed major
amendments. The applicant may seek approval of a major amendment by re-submitting the original approved plan along with the proposed
amendment to the Director for review in the same manner prescribed in subsection B.2. above.
If any site plan and/or building permit application includes a major amendment from the terms of the approved concept plan that has not
been approved by the Director, the concept plan shall be void and the application shall be reviewed for compliance with the standards of this
Subchapter and all other applicable requirements.
1.5.4.    Criteria.
Alternative equivalent compliance may be approved only if the applicant demonstrates that the following criteria have been met:
The proposed alternative achieves the intent of the subject Article of this Subchapter from which the alternative is sought; or
The proposed alternative achieves the intent of the subject Article of this Subchapter from which the alternative is sought to the maximum extent
practicable and is necessary because:
Physical characteristics unique to the subject site (such as, but not limited to, slopes, size, shape, and vegetation) make strict compliance with the
subject standard impracticable or unreasonable;
Physical design characteristics unique to the proposed use or type of use make strict compliance with the subject standard impracticable or
unreasonable; or
An undue financial hardship would be created for a development less than 10,000 square feet without any exterior trademark design feature.
1.5.5.    Effect of Approval.
Alternative compliance shall apply only to the specific site for which it is requested and shall not establish a precedent for approval of other requests.

§ 2.2. - RELATIONSHIP OF BUILDINGS TO STREETS AND WALKWAYS.
2.2.1.    Overview of Roadway Types.
Purpose. In this Subchapter, roadway types are used as an organizing tool for certain development standards. In this Section 2.2., sidewalk, building
placement, and streetscape standards and building entryway location are determined by the roadway type that is adjacent to the site. The following
five roadway types are listed from highest to lowest priority for purposes of this Subchapter (See Figures 3 - 5 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord.
20130606-088):
Core Transit Corridor;
Internal Circulation Route;
Urban Roadway;
Suburban Roadway; and
Highway or Hill Country Roadway.
Applicability. The roadway with the highest level of priority adjacent to the lot or site is considered the "principal street" for purposes of this
Subchapter. For a lot or site that is adjacent to more than one roadway of equal priority, the development shall be subject to the standards associated
with the roadway with the highest level of transit service, as determined by the Director, or if the roadways do not have transit service or the level of
transit service is equal, the roadway designated by the lot owner.
For large sites subject to Section 2.2.5. or for sites abutting more than one roadway type, the Sidewalk and Supplemental Zone requirements (but not
the Building Placement and Parking requirements) shall apply along all abutting streets or Internal Circulation Route frontages, with the applicable
requirements determined by the roadway type.
2.2.2.    Core Transit Corridors: Sidewalks and Building Placement.

2.2.2. Core Transit Corridors: Sidewalks and
Building Placement
Core Transit Corridor- All zoning districts
- Single-family residential uses are exempt, in
addition to the general exemptions in Section
1.2.4.
(See Figure 3 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Example of a Core Transit Corridor (South Congress)
(See Figure 4 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Example of an Internal Circulation Route (Midtown Commons)
(See Figure 5 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Example of Highway (1-35)
Sidewalks. In order to create an environment that is supportive of pedestrian and transit mobility, public sidewalks shall be located along both sides
of all Core Transit Corridors in accordance with the requirements of this section. Compliance with this section is required for all sites with frontage
along a Core Transit Corridor regardless of principal street designation or building placement requirements, but a development located on one side of
a street or right-of-way is not required to provide sidewalks on the opposite side of the street or right-of-way. A development that complies with the
Great Streets standards adopted by Resolution No. 040205-14, as now or hereafter amended, is exempt from the requirements of this section and
may seek any reimbursements available under the Great Streets Development program.
For development that is subject to the requirements of this section, no sidewalk shall be less than 15 feet in width, unless otherwise approved as part
of the Alternative Equivalent Compliance process. The 15-foot minimum requirement shall apply regardless of the available right-of-way. Where
required, the sidewalk shall extend onto private property to fulfill the 15-foot minimum requirement, with a sidewalk easement provided.
Sidewalks shall consist of two zones: a planting zone located adjacent to the curb, and a clear zone. (See Figures 6 - 9.) The following standards shall
apply to these zones:
(See Figure 6 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Core transit corridor sidewalk requirements. Street trees are required along core transit
corridors with an average spacing not greater than 30 feet on center.)
(See Figure 7 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Core transit corridor with underground utilities)
(See Figure 8 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Core transit corridor with overhead utility zone)
(See Figure 9 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Core transit corridor with overhead utility zone at curb)
Planting Zone.
The planting zone shall have a minimum width of eight feet (from face of curb) and shall be continuous and located adjacent to the curb.
The zone shall be planted with street trees at an average spacing not greater than 30 feet on center. The director shall adopt a list of
acceptable street trees for purposes of this section. The list shall emphasize shade trees; however, alternative trees may only be approved
(pursuant to Section 2.2.2.B.3. below) where conflicts may arise because of overhead utility lines.
In addition, the zone is intended for the placement of street furniture including seating, street lights, waste receptacles, fire hydrants, traffic
signs, newspaper vending boxes, bus shelters, bicycle racks, public utility equipment such as electric transformers and water meters, and
similar elements in a manner that does not obstruct pedestrian access or motorist visibility.
Clear Zone. The clear zone shall be a minimum width of seven feet, shall be hardscaped, shall be located adjacent to the planting zone, and shall
comply with ADA and Texas Accessibility Standards. The clear zone shall be unobstructed by any permanent or nonpermanent element for a
minimum width of seven feet and a minimum height of eight feet.
Utilities.
All utility lines shall be underground from the building to the property line. Utility lines within the right-of-way shall be placed underground or
relocated to the rear of the site to the maximum extent practicable.
Where electric utilities remain overhead and are located behind the curb, an overhead utility zone shall be provided so that no portion of the
building is located within a 10-foot radius of the energized conductor. This overhead utility zone shall be in addition to the minimum planting
zone, clear zone, and supplemental zone (if provided). Options for street tree planting and sidewalk placement in combination with overhead
utilities are illustrated in Figures 8 and 9.
(See Figures 8 and 9 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088)
On lots with a depth of 120 feet or less and where electric utilities remain overhead and are located behind the curb, alternative trees from
the list identified in Section 2.2.2.B.1.b. above may be used so that the trees can be located beneath, rather than offset from, the overhead
electric utilities.
Alternative Requirements For Shallow Lots. On lots with a depth of 150 feet or less, the total sidewalk may be reduced to 12 feet, consisting of a
seven-foot minimum planting zone and a five-foot clear zone.

Supplemental Zone (Optional). A supplemental zone may be provided at the option of the applicant between the street-facing façade line and the
required clear zone. (See Figures 10 - 11.) The following standards apply to supplemental zones:
(See Figures 10 and 11 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Optional supplemental zone may be expanded to 30 feet for a maximum
of 30 percent of the frontage.)
If a supplemental zone is provided, up to 30 percent of the linear frontage of the supplemental zone may be a maximum of 30 feet wide, and the
remainder of the supplemental zone shall be a maximum of 20 feet wide. (See Figures 10 - 11.)
Elements that support active public uses can and should be located Within the supplemental zone, including one or more of the following:
Accessory outdoor dining, provided that the dining area may be separated from the sidewalk only with planters, shrubs, or fencing with a
maximum height of 42 inches (See Figure 12.);
(See Figure 12 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Example of supplemental zone with outdoor dining.)
Balconies, pedestrian walkways, porches, handicap ramps, and stoops; provided, however, that no such feature shall extend beyond the
supplemental zone without a license agreement;
Terraces, provided that they have a maximum finished floor height of 24 inches above the sidewalk elevation and shall be surrounded by a
guardrail that meets city specifications;
Landscape and water features;
Plazas; and
Incidental display and sales.
Other improvements that support active uses as approved by the Director.
Any features in the supplemental zone must not obstruct the open pedestrian connection between the building's primary entrance and the clear
zone.
A Transit Plaza adjacent to a Capital Metro, MetroRapid Station.
Building Placement.
General Building Placement Standard. Notwithstanding the minimum setback requirements of the base zoning districts, at least 75 percent of
the net frontage length of the property along the Core Transit Corridor must consist of continuous building façade built up to the clear zone, or
the supplemental zone if one is provided. (See Figure 13.) For purposes of this Subchapter, "net frontage length" is defined in Article 5. This
minimum net frontage length requirement shall not apply if the site qualifies for one of the exceptions in this subsection.
(See Figure 13 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Examples of permitted building placement along Core Transit Corridors.
Parking is not permitted in the hatched area between the street-facing façade and the sidewalk.)
Exception: Civic Buildings. In order to provide greater flexibility to create a distinctive architectural statement, civic buildings, as defined in Article
5, do not have to be built up to the clear zone (or supplemental zone if one is provided), so long as parking is not located between the building
frontage facing the principal street and the street. (See Figure 14.)
(See Figure 14 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; The Austin City Hall is set back from the street in some areas, while other non
civic buildings meet the street. This is a traditional urban design technique intended to emphasize the importance of civic uses.)
Exception: Pad-site Building with Drive-In or Drive-Through. A lot or site containing a drive-in or drive-through building may include a circulation
lane of up to 20 feet in width between the building and the curb if the site has only one point of access to a public roadway. The drive-in or drive-
through building located behind the circulation lane need not be built up to the clear zone, but the circulation lane may not have parking and
must contain an accessible and clearly marked walkway that crosses the circulation aisle and connects the clear zone to the building's principal
entrance. (See Figure 15.)
(See Figure 15 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Drive-through uses serviced by a single curb cut do not have to meet the
building placement standards in order to allow for a circulation lane.)
Exception: Alternative Equivalent Compliance. If the applicant applies for a modification of this building placement standard through the
alternative equivalent compliance procedure in Section 1.5 because there will not be enough building frontage to meet the 75 percent net
frontage length requirement, the Director may approve an alternative design provided one of the following is met, in addition to the criteria in
Section 1.5.4.:
On a site with a single principal building:
The longer side of the building must be built up to the clear zone (or supplemental zone if provided) (See Figure 16.), or
At least one side of the building must be built up to the clear zone (or supplemental zone if provided) and the majority of the tenant
spaces must have principal entrances facing the principal street (See Figure 17.)
(See Figures 16 and 17 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Alternative building placement options.)
On a site with more than one principal building, at least one building must be built to the clear zone (or supplemental zone), and:

supplemental zone if provided) and the majority of tenant spaces in any such building must have principal entrances facing the principal
street.
Exemption for Restaurant or Service Station Redevelopment. The building placement standards in this subsection do not apply to the
redevelopment of an existing pad site restaurant or service station use by the owner or buyer if:
the use proposed is a restaurant or service station;
the redevelopment occurs within the existing site configuration:
sidewalks are provided in compliance with this section.
Exception: Small Interior Lots. Development on interior lots with 65 feet or less of frontage on the principal street and with vehicular access only
from the principal street is exempt from the building placement standards of this subsection.
Off-Street Parking.
Off-street parking is prohibited between the Core Transit Corridor and the corresponding street-facing façade line. (See Figure 18.)
(See Figure 18 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Parking to the side of a building is permitted but screening is required
between the parking and the sidewalk. No parking is permitted between the building and the sidewalk on a Core Transit Corridor.)
Any off-street surface parking along a Core Transit Corridor shall have landscape buffering in accord with Section 25-2-1006 of the LDC between
the clear zone (or the supplemental zone if provided) and the parking area. The buffering method chosen must include shade trees.

above.
Building Placement.
On Suburban Roadways, parking is discouraged between the building and the street. (See Figure 27.) If the property meets the building placement
requirements for Urban Roadways as set forth in Section 2.2.3.D. above and no parking is located between the principal street and any street-
facing building elevation, the project is exempt from the connectivity requirements in Section 2.3.1.
(See Figure 27 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Parking is discouraged between the building and the street on Suburban Roadways.)
Exception: Pad-site Building with Drive-In or Drive-Through. A lot or site containing a drive-in or drive-through building may include a circulation
lane of up to 20 feet in width between the building and the curb if the site has only one point of access to a public roadway. The drive-in or drive-
through building located behind the circulation lane need not be built up to the clear zone, but the circulation lane may not have parking and
must contain an accessible and clearly marked walkway that crosses the circulation aisle and connects the clear zone to the building's principal
entrance. (See Figure 15.)
(See Figure 15 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Drive-through uses serviced by a single curb cut do not have to meet the building
placement standards in order to allow for a circulation lane.)
Parking. Parking along the street frontage must have:
Landscape buffering in accordance with Section 25-2-1006 of the LDC; and
A sidewalk, planted with trees at an average spacing not greater than 30 on center, leading to the main customer entrance from the property line.
No more than two drive aisles may cross the sidewalk. For multi-tenant developments, there must be a shaded sidewalk for at least every 330 feet
of frontage along the suburban roadway frontage.
Corner Sites. For sites located on a corner on Suburban Roadways:
Surface parking is prohibited within the rectangular area formed by the setback lines as measured 100 feet back from the curb line corners (or the
intersection of the curb line tangents), unless (See Figure 28.):
(See Figure 28 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Corner Site on a Suburban Roadway (shown as "principal street"))
Landscape buffering between the parking area and the sidewalk is provided in accordance with Section 25-2-1006 of the LDC; and
One hundred percent of the building frontage that faces the principal street shall be built to the clear zone (or supplemental zone if provided).
The development may not contain an auto-oriented use unless it meets option a. or b. in 2.2.4.E.1. above. For purposes of this provision, auto-

Internal Circulation Route. An Internal Circulation Route that establishes blocks and forms an interconnected, grid-like transportation system must
be provided for development subject to this section. (See Figure 29.) An Internal Circulation Route must comply with the requirements of this
subsection and should provide a safe and enjoyable walking environment overlooked by buildings that offer natural surveillance and contact from
their occupants/users.
(See Figure 29 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Example Internal Circulation Route system, blocks must not exceed 5 acres.)
Block Standards.
Maximum Block Size. Unless exempted by this subsection, a site shall be divided into internal blocks no larger than 5 acres. The maximum length
of any block face, as measured from intersection to intersection, shall be 800 feet.
Exemptions from Maximum Block Size.
Sites Over 15 Acres. On sites 15 acres or larger, the site may contain one block with a maximum area of 10 acres for each 30 acres (i.e., one
10-acre block on a site of between 15 to 30 acres, two 10-acre blocks on a site of between 30 to 60 acres, etc.). The maximum length of any
block face, as measured from intersection to intersection shall be 800 feet.
Office Sites in Drinking Water Protection Zone or Water Supply Watershed. The maximum block length standard does not apply to any site
in the Drinking Water Protection Zone or a Water Supply Watershed designated as a neighborhood office (NO), limited office (LP), or general
office (GO) district.
Sites on a Hill Country Roadway. Compliance with this Subsection is not required for the block front adjacent to a Hill Country Roadway to be
divided in a manner inconsistent with Chapter 25-6, Article 6, Division 2 (Access to Hill Country Roadways) or state highway access spacing
requirements.
Subdivision of Internal Blocks. Internal blocks abutting Internal Circulation Routes may be subdivided to allow for the sale and development of
individual blocks without frontage on a public street if the Director determines that the Internal Circulation Routes are equivalent to a public
street in terms of utilities, pavement design, and vehicle access requirements. For the purpose of compliance with setback and minimum lot
frontage requirements, an Internal Circulation Route is considered equivalent to a public street.
Project Circulation Plan.
Plan Requirements.
A Project Circulation Plan depicting Internal Circulation Routes required by this section must be submitted with a site plan application for an
area of 5 acres or larger.
The Project Circulation Plan must demonstrate that the project:
meets the applicable requirements of this section and Section 2.3 (Connectivity) of this Subchapter;
integrates with existing and planned streets, bicycle and pedestrian facilities, and trails in the surrounding area; and
is consistent with area mobility goals, as contained in the Transportation Plan or an approved collector plan.
Director Approval.
A Project Circulation Plan must be reviewed and approved by the director under the requirements of this section.
The Director may approve a Project Circulation Plan containing blocks bounded by railroad right-of-way, subdivision boundary lines, or natural
features if no reasonable alternatives are available.
Revisions to the Project Circulation Plan may be approved by the Director after considering the circulation characteristics of a proposed
development plan, the need for access to adjoining properties, and the compatibility of surrounding development.
The Director may waive the requirement for a Project Circulation Plan if the Director finds that a plan is not necessary due to the nature of the
proposed development on the site, the existence of surrounding incompatible development, or other factors unique to the property which
make strict compliance infeasible.
Sidewalks.
Sidewalk Requirements.
Publicly accessible sidewalks shall be provided along both sides of all Internal Circulation Routes (whether built as public streets or as private
drives) unless:
no buildable area exists on one side.
On portions of the Internal Circulation Route with building frontage the sidewalks and supplemental zones shall:
comply with the applicable standards for Urban Roadways, as provided in Section 2.2.3 (Urban Roadways: Sidewalk and Building
Placement), and
The planting zone shall be planted with street trees at an average spacing not greater than 30 feet on center. (See Figure 30.)

Route or the adjacent public roadway of the highest priority. Each building must meet the building placement standards of the roadway to which it
is oriented.
Building Placement Along an Internal Circulation Route. The following standards apply where required building frontage is provided along an
Internal Circulation Route:
On a site with a single principal building:
The longer side of the building must be built up to the clear zone (or supplemental zone if provided), or
At least one side of the building must be built up to the clear zone (or supplemental zone if provided) and the majority of the tenant
spaces must have principal entrances facing the Internal Circulation Route.
On a site with more than one principal building:
The longer side of any building, any portion of which is within 100 feet of the Internal Circulation Route, must be built up to the clear zone
(or supplemental zone if provided), or
At least one side of any building, any portion of which is within 100 feet of the Internal Circulation Route, must be built up to the clear zone
(or supplemental zone if provided) and the majority of tenant spaces in any such building must have principal entrances facing the Internal
Circulation Route.
Parking.
Off-street parking is prohibited between the Internal Circulation Route and the corresponding street-facing façade line.
On-street parallel, head-in angle, and reverse angle parking are allowed on an Internal Circulation Route, subject to compliance with fire access
standards, and, if the Internal Circulation Route is a public street, subject to approval of the Director of Public Works based on administrative
criteria to be adopted. If the Internal Circulation Route is intended to accommodate bicycles, head-in and angle parking is not permitted.
Joint Access. If necessary to ensure access to the Internal Circulation Route by the general public and transit vehicles, the director may require joint
use driveways within the site to adjacent properties.
On a suburban roadway, a residential only use on a site over 5 acres is exempt from Sections 2.2.5.A-G and must comply with the following:
Sidewalks or pedestrian paths are required to connect all buildings and all amenities; and

Location Criteria. To the maximum extent feasible, where significant natural and scenic resource assets exist on a property, the developer shall give
priority to their preservation as private common open space. In reviewing the proposed location of private common open space areas, the Director
shall use all applicable plans, maps, and reports to determine whether significant resources exist on a proposed site that should be protected, with
priority being given to the following areas (which are not listed in a particular order):
Wetlands;
Flood hazard areas;
Lakes, rivers, and stream/riparian corridors;
Tree preservation areas (See Figure 37.);
(See Figure 37 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Example of tree preservation during construction.)
Karst areas;
Cultural or historically significant structures, landscapes, features, and/or places; and
Agricultural lands used for cultivation of local produce.
Where private common open space areas, trails, parks, or other public spaces exist or are proposed in the City of Austin Trails Master Plan, Austin
Parks and Recreation Long-Range Plan, Sidewalk Master Plan, or Bicycle Plan within or adjacent to the tract to be subdivided or developed, the private
common open space or pedestrian amenity shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be located to adjoin, extend, and enlarge the presently existing or
proposed trail, park, or other open area land. Public access easements may be required in order to guarantee public access to these facilities.
Where there is a BRT station adjacent to the tract to be developed, a portion of the private common open space or pedestrian amenity shall, to the
maximum extent feasible, be located to adjoin, extend, and enlarge the presently existing or permitted station. For sites greater than one acre, the
open space should be a minimum of 150 s.f. plus an additional 100 s.f. per acre over one, not to exceed 1,000 s.f. This will apply only outside the
Central Business District (CBD) and downtown-mixed-use (DMU) zoning.
Areas Not Credited. Lands within the following areas shall not be counted towards private common open space or pedestrian amenities required by
this section:
Open space in a required street yard;
Public or private streets or rights of way;
Off-street parking, loading areas, driveways, and service areas; and
Water quality and storm water detention ponds, unless designed as an accessible amenity and approved by the Director.
Design Criteria. Land set aside for private common open space or pedestrian amenities pursuant to this section shall meet the following design
criteria, as relevant:
Common open space areas shall be located so as to be readily accessible and useable by residents or visitors in various locations of the
development, unless the lands are sensitive natural resources and access should be restricted.
Open space areas shall be compact and contiguous unless the open space is used as a continuation of an existing trail, or specific or unique
topographic features that are adjacent or adjoining require a different configuration. An example of such topographic features would be the
provision of a trail or private open area along a riparian corridor.
The surface of a required open space must be suitable for outdoor activities. A surface must consist of lawn, garden, flagstone, wood planking,
concrete, or other serviceable, dust free material. Asphalt or similar surfacing may be used for designated recreation areas such as multi-purpose
trails, tennis courts, and basketball courts. Decomposed granite may be used if approved by the Director and if accessibility requirements are
met. A combination of different materials is encouraged.
Except as provided in this subsection, not more than 30 percent of the required open space may be located on a roof, balcony, or other area
above ground level. In determining the amount of open space on a roof, an area occupied by a vent, mechanical equipment or structure that does
not enhance the usability of the space is excluded.
Up to 50 percent of the required private common open space may be located on a roof, balcony, or other area above ground level if at least 50
percent of the open space above ground level is designed as a Vegetated or Green Roof. For the purpose of this section, a Vegetated or Green
Roof is an assembly or system, over an occupied space, that supports an area of planted bed(s), built up on a waterproofed surface at any level
that is contained separately from the natural ground by a human-made structure. A Vegetated or Green Roof must comply with the performance
standards adopted by rule.
Private common open space on a roof, balcony, or other area above ground level must be screened from the view of adjacent property that is in
an urban residence (SF-5) or more restrictive zoning district, in accordance with the standards in Section 25-2-1066 (Screening Requirements).
A project which allows public access during normal business hours to a private common open space above ground level may reduce the total
amount of open space required by 10 percent.
This subsection provides for the covering of a required open space.

In VMU and V zoning districts, streetscape improvements within the public right-of-way may be included in the calculation of open space except
for the area within the Clear Zone as defined in this Subchapter. This provision does not apply to streetscape projects for which the City
participates in the cost of the improvements or which are required to be constructed as a condition of CURE zoning.
Maintenance. All private common open space or pedestrian amenity areas shall be permanently maintained by the owners of the development.
Fee In Lieu.
Instead of providing private common open space or pedestrian amenities as required in this section, the developer of a property located within
the urban roadways boundary (as defined in Article 5 of this Subchapter) may request approval to deposit with the city a nonrefundable cash
payment to be used for the acquisition or improvement of open space that will serve residents of the development.
The criteria for approving payment of a fee and the formula for calculating the fee amount shall be adopted by the city council, with a
recommendation from the Director.
The Director shall review a request for payment of a fee based on the adopted criteria and accept or deny the request no later than 15 days
following its receipt.

ARTICLE 4: - MIXED USE.
§ 4.1. - INTENT.
This Article 4 is intended to provide for and encourage development and redevelopment that contains a compatible mix of residential, commercial, and
institutional uses within close proximity to each other, rather than separating uses. The mixed use provisions define the uses of land and the siting and character of
the improvements and structures allowed on the land in a manner that encourages a balanced and sustainable mix of uses. They promote an efficient pedestrian-
access network that connects the nonresidential and residential uses and transit facilities. Redevelopment of underutilized parcels and infill development of vacant
parcels should foster pedestrian-oriented residential and mixed use development. (See Figure 45.)
(See Figure 45 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Examples of vertical mixed use)
COMMENTARY: MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT IN AUSTIN GENERALLY
The City of Austin allows and encourages the development of mixed use projects. Mixed use development integrates two or more land uses,
such as residential and commercial, with a strong pedestrian orientation. Requirements and standards for mixed use development appear in
various places throughout the Austin City Code.
Zoning Districts in which Mixed Use is Allowed and Encouraged
The following districts are intended primarily for mixed use development and are described more fully in Section 4.2 below:
• Mixed Use Combining District (Section 4.2.1.).
• Vertical Mixed Use Overlay District (Section 4.2.2.).
Mixed use development also is allowed in other Austin zoning districts. Some of these districts are listed below and are described more fully in
the referenced sections of the Austin Code. This list is not exhaustive, but rather is intended to illustrate the range of districts in which mixed
use development is allowed.
• Central Business (CBD) (Section 25-2-100);

• Central Urban Redevelopment (CURE) (Section 25-2-163);
• Downtown Mixed Use (DMU) (Section 25-2-101);
• Planned Development Area (PDA) (Section 25-2-174);
• Planned Unit Development (Section 25-2-144);
• Traditional Neighborhood Development (Section 25-2-146);
• Transit Oriented Development (Section 25-2-147);
• Waterfront Overlay (WO) (Section 25-2-175); and
• University Neighborhood Overlay (UNO) (Section 25-2-178).
Types of Mixed Use Development
Within the districts that allow mixed use development, uses may be combined either vertically in the same building, or horizontally in multiple
buildings, or through a combination of the two, depending on the standards of the district.
Vertical mixed use is allowed in two building types: the Vertical Mixed Use (VMU) Building and the Neighborhood Mixed Use (NMU) Building.
Standards for VMU buildings are in Section 4.3. below, and standards for NMU buildings are in Subchapter D, Article 6.
Horizontal mixed use is the mixing of uses in a development project, though not necessarily in the same building. Horizontal mixed use is
allowed and encouraged in Austin so long as each of the proposed uses is allowed within the applicable zoning district and the development
meets all applicable requirements of the Austin Code.

4.3.3.    Standards.
A VMU building shall meet the following requirements:
Pre-Application Conference. Prior to filing any application for a development that will contain a VMU building, the developer shall request in writing a
pre-application conference with the Director. The purpose of a pre-application conference is to provide an opportunity for an informal evaluation of
the applicant's proposal and to familiarize the applicant and the city staff with the applicable provisions of this Subchapter such as the VMU
affordability requirements, and other issues that may affect the applicant's proposal (e.g., accessibility requirements). The informal evaluation of the
Director and staff provided at the conference are not binding upon the applicant or the city, but are intended to serve as a guide to the applicant in
making the application.
Mix of Uses. A use on the ground floor must be different from a use on an upper floor. The second floor may be designed to have the same use as the
ground floor so long as there is at least one more floor above the second floor that has a different use from the first two floors. At least one of the
floors shall contain residential dwelling units. (See Figure 46.)
(See Figure 46 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Examples (not a comprehensive list) of use mixes that would meet these requirements.)
Pedestrian-Oriented Commercial Spaces. Along at least 75 percent of the building frontage along the principal street, the building must be designed
for commercial uses in ground-floor spaces that meet the following standards. A lobby serving another use in the VMU building shall not count as a
pedestrian-oriented commercial space for purposes of this section.
Dimensional Requirements. Each ground-floor commercial space must have: (See Figure 47.)
(See Figure 47 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Pedestrian-Oriented Commercial Spaces.)
A customer entrance that opens directly onto the sidewalk;

Minimum site area requirements (if applicable);
Maximum floor area ratio;
Maximum building coverage;
Minimum street side yard setback and interior yard setback; and
Minimum front yard setback; provided, however, that if the right-of-way is less than 60 feet in width, the minimum front yard setback for
buildings three or more stories in height shall be 30 feet from the centerline of the street to ensure adequate Fire Department access.
For all uses in a VMU building, the minimum off-street parking requirement shall be 60 percent of that prescribed by Appendix A (Tables of Off-
Street Parking and Loading Requirements). This reduction may not be used in combination with any other parking reduction. Only the parking
requirements for commercial uses are subject to modification through the opt-in/opt-out process in Section 4.3.5.
Affordability Requirements. To be eligible for the dimensional or parking standards exemption in Subsection E of this section, the residential units in
a VMU building shall meet the following affordability requirements, which shall run with the land. This ordinance does not amend or repeal graphics
or pictures that are used to illustrate various code requirements in the published version of Chapter 25-2, Subchapter E (Design Standards and Mixed
Use).
Affordability Requirements for Owner-Occupied Units.
Five percent of the residential units in the VMU building shall be reserved as affordable, for not less than 99 years from the date a certificate of
occupancy is issued, for ownership and occupancy by households earning no more than 80 percent of the current Annual Median Family
Income for the City of Austin Metropolitan Statistical Area as determined by the Director of Neighborhood Housing and Community
Development Department.
In addition, five percent of the residential units in the VMU building shall be reserved, for not less than 99 years from the date a certificate of
occupancy is issued, for ownership and occupancy by households earning no more than 100 percent of the Annual Median Family Income.
The City in its sole discretion may elect to subsidize an additional ten percent of the for-sale residential units in the building, at an affordability
level consistent with criteria and procedures established by the Director.
Affordability Requirements for Rental Units.
Ten percent of the residential units in the VMU building shall be reserved as affordable, for a minimum of 40 years following the issuance of
the certificate of occupancy, for rental by households earning no more than 80 percent of the Annual Median Family Income.
As part of the one-time opt-in/opt-out process described in Section 4.3.5., an applicable neighborhood association or neighborhood planning
team may request that the affordable rental units be available for renters earning a lower percentage of the annual median family income, to
as low as 60 percent of the median family income. VMU projects that file zoning or site plan applications after the effective date of the first
interim VMU ordinance and prior to September 1, 2006, will not be subject to this neighborhood affordability customization; and instead shall
set aside affordable rental units as required by subsection 2.a. above or provide for affordable units as otherwise agreed to by an applicable
neighborhood prior to September 1,2006, provided that VMU projects are allowed on the applicable site following the completion of the opt-
in/opt-out process.
The city may elect to subsidize an additional ten percent of the residential units in the building for rental purposes for residents at any level of
affordability pursuant to criteria and procedures established by the Director.
Affordability Definition. For purposes of this subsection, a unit is affordable for purchase or rental if the household is required to spend no more
than 30 percent of its gross monthly income on utilities and mortage or rental payments for the unit as determined by the City's Neighborhood
Housing and Community Development Department, based on the current Annual Median Family Income for the Austin Metropolitan Statistical
Area.
Fee for Upper-Level Nonresidential Space. The developers of VMU buildings that contain nonresidential uses above the ground-floor shall pay a
fee as set by the City Council for all climate-controlled nonresidential space above the ground floor. At the same time that it sets the amount of
the fee, the City Council shall also identify a means by which fees paid pursuant to this section shall be reserved only for expenditure within the
area of the City from which they were collected.
Monitoring and Enforcement. The City shall develop procedures to monitor and enforce this section.

Mixed Use Buildings Other than VMU. If a building that otherwise meets the standards for VMU buildings may be developed using the site
development standards of the underlying zoning category, and without the use of the dimensional standard waivers of Section 4.3.3.E., then that
building need not comply with the standards (including affordability) that otherwise apply to VMU buildings.
4.3.4.    Development Bonuses and Expedited Review of Residential Parking Permit Districts.
Bonuses for VMU Buildings. A building that contains at least 100 lineal feet of VMU building frontage along the principal street is entitled to the
following development bonuses:
The queuing requirements of Chapter 25-6, Appendix A, shall be reduced by 50 percent for each drive-through service in the development, so long
as sufficient on-site queuing space exists to ensure queuing does not occur within the public right-of-way.
The number of connectivity options needed to comply with Section 2.3.1.B.2. of this Subchapter shall be reduced by two for each 100 lineal feet of
VMU buildings.
All buildings in the development may aggregate points for building design in Section 3.3 of this Subchapter, rather than each building needing the
minimum number of points.
Except for in the Barton Springs Zone or the Waterfront Overlay combining district, impervious cover existing as of the effective date of this
Subchapter may be retained for redevelopment purposes for VMU buildings no taller than 60 feet and their accompanying structured parking, so
long as the redevelopment meets current water quality standards and, for projects in the Drinking Water Protection Zone, the redevelopment
incorporates the following measures to provide additional water quality benefits, pursuant to administrative rules to be developed by the director:
Rainwater collection and reuse;
Pervious pavement;
Integrated pest management; and
Native and adapted landscaping.
Expedited Review for Residential Permit Parking Districts. Neighborhoods that do not opt out of the VMU overlay district pursuant to the process
established in Section 4.3.5. shall receive expedited review of applications to establish Residential Permit Parking (RPP) districts, for blocks starting
within 600 feet of the portion of the Core Transit Corridor or Future Core Transit Corridor within the VMU overlay. The application process shall
proceed in accordance with the guidelines and procedures which are in effect at the time of the application except as described below:
The applicable neighborhood association must endorse the resident's request for the Residential Permit Parking program.
Requirements for conducting parking studies or collecting license plate information shall be waived.
Following the collection of the required signatures and delivery of all necessary RPP request documentation to City staff, staff shall review and act
on the application within two weeks. Notice shall be sent to affected residents and the applicable neighborhood association, and signs shall be
installed, within six weeks of approval.
4.3.5.    Individual Neighborhood Consideration of VMU Requirements ("Opt-in/Opt-out Process").
Purpose. The purpose of this subsection is to establish a one-time process, which will begin following the adoption of this Subchapter, whereby
individual neighborhoods may consider certain development characteristics of VMU buildings within their boundaries and communicate their
preferences to the City Council. No property is eligible for an exemption from the dimensional standards (of Section 4.3.3.E.2.) or for the additional
ground-floor uses otherwise authorized by Section 4.3.3.C.2. until the conclusion of the opt-in and opt-out processes described in this section.
Procedure.
Initiation. Upon the adoption date of this Subchapter, the Director shall identify neighborhood areas and notify each neighborhood planning
team that the VMU neighborhood consideration process shall be initiated. If there is no neighborhood planning team, the applicable
neighborhood associations in a neighborhood shall work together to develop an opt-in/opt-out application for the purposes of this section.
Application. Each neighborhood planning team or neighborhood association shall review the VMU standards in Section 4.3.3. The planning team
or applicable neighborhood association may, no later than 90 days after receiving written notice from the Director of this Subchapter's adoption,
submit an opt-in/optout application to the City Manager concerning any of the items listed in subsection C. below. The planning team or
neighborhood association may amend a timely filed application not later than August 9, 2007.
Planning Commission Recommendation. The City Manager shall forward any opt-in/opt-out applications received to the Planning Commission,
which shall review and make recommendations on all such applications to the City Council.
City Council Decision. After considering the Planning Commission's recommendations, the Council may by ordinance approve, approve with
conditions, or deny each opt-in/optout request. The Council may concurrently amend the appropriate neighborhood plan. The neighborhood plan
amendment process does not apply to the amendment.
Effect of Approval. Following completion of this one-time opt-in/opt-out process:
The director shall indicate on the zoning map with map code "V" each property receiving an exemption from the dimensional standards under
Section 4.3.3.E.2, additional ground floor commercial uses under Section 4.3.3.C.2, or a reduction in the median family income for affordable
rental housing under Section 4.3.3.F.2.b. The "V" shall include properties receiving the exemption under Section 4.3.5.B.4. pursuant to Council
action on an opt-out application, or under Section 4.3.5.C.l.b. if no application has been filed.

Any subsequent amendments to the VMU standards in a neighborhood shall require amendment of the applicable neighborhood plan and
neighborhood plan combining district.
Any property owner or neighborhood association may submit an application to change the VMU rules on a specific property or properties by
amending the applicable neighborhood plan and neighborhood plan combining district to opt-in to the exemption from the dimensional
standards of Section 4.3.3.E.2 and/or the additional ground-floor uses identified by Section 4.3.3.C.2.
Any property owner may file a zoning application for Vertical Mixed Use (V) or Mixed Use (MU) combining district, regardless of whether a
neighborhood plan combining district has been adopted.
Types of Opt-in/Opt-Out Applications. Only the following types of opt-in/opt-out applications may be submitted:
VMU Overlay District: Opt-out.
A neighborhood with properties in the VMU overlay district may request that the neighborhood "opt-out" of the dimensional standards
exemption in Section 4.3.3.E.2., and/or the ground-floor commercial uses allowed in Section 4.3.3.C.2. for some or all of the properties within
the VMU overlay district. If such an opt-out application is submitted and approved, the applicable standards shall not apply to affected VMU
buildings within that neighborhood; instead, such buildings shall be required to comply with all dimensional and/or use standards applicable
to the base zoning district. Such buildings also shall comply with the applicable minimum site area requirements in the MU combining district;
see Section 4.2.1.D.6.
If no opt-out application is submitted on a property, or an opt-out application is submitted and denied, the dimensional standard exemption
in Section 4.3.3.E.2. and the ground-floor commercial use provisions in Section 4.3.3.C.2. shall apply to all VMU buildings on that property.
MU-Designated Properties: Opt-in.
A neighborhood with properties with the MU zoning designation may request to "opt-in" to the dimensional standards exemption in Section
4.3.3.E.2., and/or the ground floor commercial uses allowed in Section 4.3.3.C.2. for some or all of the properties with the MU zoning
designation. If such an opt-in application is submitted and approved, the dimensional and/or use standards shall apply to VMU buildings on
sites with the MU zoning designation within the applicable neighborhood boundaries.
If no opt-in application is submitted for a property, or an opt-in application is submitted and denied, VMU buildings on a property designated
MU shall comply with all dimensional and use standards applicable to the base zoning district and the MU combining district.
Properties Not in VMU Overlay District and without MU Designation: Opt-in to VMU. Any neighborhood that desires to allow VMU buildings
within its boundaries on commercially zoned properties that are not otherwise eligible for VMU buildings under this Subchapter may submit an
"opt-in" application to allow such development. The application shall specify the properties on which the neighborhood wishes to allow VMU
buildings, whether the ground-floor commercial listed in Section 4.3.3.C.2. should be allowed, and whether the dimensional standards exemption
of Section 4.3.3.E.2. should apply.
All Properties that Allow VMU Buildings: Affordability Standards. Also as part of the opt-in/opt-out process, for each neighborhood in which
VMU buildings are allowed, the neighborhood association or neighborhood planning team may request that the affordable rental units be
available for renters earning a lower percentage of the area median family income, to as low as 60 percent of the median family income, pursuant
to Section 4.3.3.F.2.b.
VMU Overlay District: Residential Opt-in. A neighbor-hood that desires to allow VMU buildings within its boundaries on property in a VMU
overlay district that is used exclusively for residential use and that is not designated as a MU combining district may submit an application to allow
the development. The application shall specify the properties on which the neighborhood wishes to allow VMU buildings, whether ground-floor
commercial listed in Section 4.3.3.C.2 should be allowed, and whether the dimensional standards of Section 4.3.3.E.2 should apply.
Removal from the VMU Overlay District. A neighborhood may request that the Council amend the boundaries of the VMU overlay district to
remove a property from the overlay district.

ARTICLE 2: - DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
§ 2.1. - MAXIMUM DEVELOPMENT PERMITTED.
The maximum amount of development permitted on a property subject to this Subchapter is limited to the greater of 0.4 to 1.0 floor-to-area ratio or
2,300 square feet of gross floor area, as defined in Section 3.3. Floor-to-area ratio shall be measured using gross floor area as defined in Section 3.3,
except that the lot area of a flag lot is calculated consistent with the requirements of Section 25-1-22 (Measurements).

§ 2.2. - BUILDING HEIGHT.
Except where these regulations are superseded, the maximum building height for development subject to this Subchapter is:
32 feet for development located outside the 100-year floodplain; and
35 feet for development located in the 100-year floodplain.
Section 25-2-531 (Height Limit Exceptions) does not apply to development subject to this Subchapter, except for a chimney, vent, antenna, or energy
conservation or production equipment or feature not designed for occupancy. Building height shall be measured under the requirements defined in
Section 3.4.

§ 2.3. - FRONT YARD SETBACK.
Minimum Setback Required. The minimum front yard setback required for development subject to this Subchapter is the lesser of:
The minimum front yard setback prescribed by the other provisions of this Code; or
The average front yard setback, if an average may be determined as provided in Subsection B. below.
Average Front Yard Setback. The following rules apply for purposes of the setback calculation required by Paragraph A.2:
A front yard setback is the distance between the front lot line and the closest front exterior wall or building façade of the principal residential
structure located on the lot.
Except as provided in paragraph 3, average front yard setback is determined using the front yard setback of the four principal residential structures
that are: (a) built within fifty feet of the front lot line; and (b) closest to, and on the same side of the block, as the property subject to the setback
required by this section.
If less than four structures satisfy the criteria in paragraph B.2, average front yard setback is calculated using the number of existing residential
structures on the same side of the street block as the property subject to the setback required by this section. If there are no structures on the same
side of the block, average front yard setback is calculated using the front yard setbacks of the four structures on the opposite side of the block that
are closest to the property subject to the setback required by this section. If there are less than four structures on the opposite side of the block, the
lesser number of structures is used in the calculation. See Figure 1.
Figure 1: Average Front Yard Setback
In this example, the minimum required front setback in the underlying zoning district is 25 feet. However, because of the variety in existing setbacks of
buildings on the same block face, new development on lot C may be located with a setback of only 20 feet, which is the average of the setbacks of lots B, D,
and E. The building on lot A is not included in the average because it is located more than 50 feet from the property line.

§ 2.4. - REAR YARD SETBACK.
The principal structure shall comply with the rear yard setback prescribed by other provisions of this Code. All other structures shall comply with the rear
yard setback provisions of this Code, but the minimum rear yard setback of a second dwelling unit may be reduced to five feet if the rear lot line is
adjacent to an alley. See Figure 2.

§ 2.6. - SETBACK PLANES.
This subsection prescribes side and rear setback planes in order to minimize the impact of new development and rear development on adjacent
properties. A structure may not extend beyond a setback plane except as authorized by subsection D. below. The height of a setback plane shall be
measured under the requirements defined in Section 3.4.
Side Setback Plane. Except as provided in subsection B. below, an inwardly sloping 45-degree angle side setback plane begins at a horizontal line 15 feet
directly above the side property line. The 15-foot height of the horizontal line is established for 40-foot deep portions of the lot beginning at the building
line and extending to the rear of the lot, except that the last portion at the rear of the lot may be less than 40 feet deep. See Figures 3 through 5.
For the first portion, the 15-foot height of the horizontal line is measured at the highest of the elevations of the four intersections of the side lot lines,
the building line, and a line 40 feet from and parallel to the building line.
For successive portions other than the last portion, the 15-foot height of the horizontal line is measured at the highest of the elevations of the four
intersections of the side lot lines and the appropriate two lines that are 40 feet apart and parallel to the building line.
For the last portion, the 15-foot height of the horizontal line is measured at the highest of the elevations of the four intersections of the side lot lines,
the appropriate line parallel to the building line, and the rear lot line.

For each portion of the side setback plane, the 15-foot height of the horizontal line is measured starting from the highest point of the four intersections
defining the portion. In this example, topography lines indicate that the lot is sloping downward from the rear to the front of the lot, and from the right to
the left. The high points for Portions 1, 2, and 3 are indicated, along with the Building Line.
Rear Setback Plane. Except as provided in subsection D., an inwardly sloping 45-degree angle rear setback plane begins at a horizontal line directly above
the rear property line at the same elevation as the horizontal line for the last portion of the side setback plane established in paragraph A.3. See Figures 6
through 9.

This figure shows the same concept illustrated in Figure 10 but for a corner lot that has a greater street side yard setback requirement. In this example, the
minimum required street side yard setback in the underlying zoning district is 15 feet. Because the side setback plane is measured from the side property
line, the height of the setback plane is 30 feet at the 15-foot street side yard setback line.
Side and Rear Setback Plane Exceptions for Existing One-Story Buildings.
Except as provided in paragraph 3 below, an applicant proposing to add a second story to a one-story building may choose either of the following side
setback planes for the portion of the project that is within the building footprint originally constructed, or permitted for original construction, before
October 1, 2006:
The side setback plane required under subsection A.
The inwardly sloping 45-degree angle side setback plane that begins at a horizontal line directly above the outermost side wall at a height equal to
the height of the first floor wall plate that was originally constructed or received a building permit before October 1, 2006, plus 10 and one-half
feet. See Figure 12. The wall plate is the lowest point of the existing first floor ceiling framing that intersects the exterior wall.
Except as provided in paragraph 3 below, an applicant proposing to add a second story to a one-story building may choose either of the following rear
setback planes for the portion of the project that is within the building footprint originally constructed, or permitted for original construction, before
October 1, 2006:
The rear setback plane required under subsection B.
An inwardly sloping 45-degree angle rear setback plane that begins at a horizontal line directly above the rear property line at a height equal to
the height of the first floor wall plate that was originally constructed or received a building permit before October 1, 2006, plus 10 and one-half
feet.
The side setback plane required under subsection A, and the rear setback plane required under subsection B, apply to:
any portion of the proposed construction that is outside of the building footprint originally constructed, or permitted for original construction,
before October 1, 2006; and
the entire project, if any portion of the proposed construction requires the removal or demolition of exterior walls.
Figure 12: Side Setback Plane Exception for Existing Single-Story Buildings
The side setback planes for an existing single-story building are determined based on the height of the sidewall. In this example, the horizontal line that
forms the base of the setback plane is placed ten feet and six inches above the sidewall height (12 feet). The revised plane rises above the standard setback
plane within the area of the building footprint. The standard setback planes created in Sections 2.6. A. and B. apply outside of the existing footprint.
Exceptions. A structure may not extend beyond a setback plane, except for:
A roof overhang or eave, up to two feet beyond the setback plane;
A chimney, vent, antenna, or energy conservation or production equipment or feature not designed for occupancy; and

30-Foot Side-Gabled Roof Exception. A side-gabled roof structure on each side of the building, with a total horizontal length of not more than 30
feet, measured from the building line along the intersection with the side setback plane (See Figure 13.); or
Gables Plus Dormers Exception.
Gables or a shed roof, with a total horizontal length of not more than 18 feet on each side of the building, measured along the intersection
with the setback plane (See Figures 14 and 17.); and
Dormers, with a total horizontal length of not more than 15 feet on each side of the building, measured along the intersection with the
setback plane. (See Figures 15 and 16.)
Figure 13: Side-Gabled Rood Exception
A side-gabled roof may project through the side setback plane for a horizontal distance of up to a maximum of 30 feet, measured from the building line. In
this example, the gable intrudes into the setback plane beginning 9 feet behind the building line. Therefore, the maximum length of the gable intrusion
would be 21 feet.

§ 2.7. - SIDE WALL ARTICULATION.
2.7.1.
Except as provided in subsection 2.7.2, if a side wall of a building is more than 15 feet high and is an average distance of less than nine feet from an interior lot line,
the sidewall may not extend in an unbroken plane for more than 36 feet along a side lot line without a sidewall articulation that meets the requirements of this
section.
To beak the plane, a sidewall articulation must:
be perpendicular to the side property line, at least four feet deep, and extend along the side property line for at least 10 feet, as shown in Figures
18 through 20;
extend the entire height of the first floor of an addition to, or remodel of, an existing one-story building;
extend the entire height of the second story of an addition to, or remodel of, a two or more story building;
extend to the height of the top floor of a newly constructed building; and
extend evenly upward for its entire height.
A sidewall articulation cannot:
create patios or decks or be screened from view; or
serve as an eave or gutter.
Sidewall articulation required under this section may be satisfied by horizontal articulation, such that each story above the first story is setback
further from the property line by at least nine feet and extends along the side property line for at least 10 feet.
For purposes of subsection 2.7.1, wall height:
excludes side gables; and
is measured from the lower of natural or finished grade adjacent to the structure up to the first floor wall plate, which is the lowest point of the
existing first floor ceiling framing that intersects the exterior wall.

CHAPTER 25-3. - TRADITIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD DISTRICT.
ARTICLE 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS.
§ 25-3-1 - SCOPE OF CHAPTER.
This chapter regulates the design and development of a traditional neighborhood zoning district.
Source: Section 13-9-1; Ord. 990225-70; Ord. 031211-11.
§ 25-3-2 - PURPOSE AND DESIGN.
The purpose of a traditional neighborhood district is to encourage mixed-use, compact development that is sensitive to the environmental characteristics
of the land and facilitates the efficient use of services. A traditional neighborhood district diversifies and integrates land uses within close proximity to
each other, and it provides for the daily recreational and shopping needs of the residents. A traditional neighborhood district is a sustainable, long-term
community that provides economic opportunity and environmental and social equity for the residents.
A traditional neighborhood district is designed to ensure the development of land as a traditional neighborhood. Its design adopts the urban conventions
which were the norm in the United States from colonial times until the 1940's. A traditional neighborhood district is characterized by the following design
elements:
neighborhoods that are limited in size and oriented toward pedestrian activity;
a variety of housing types, jobs, shopping, services, and public facilities;
residences, shops, workplaces, and civic buildings interwoven within the neighborhood, all within close proximity;

a network of interconnecting streets and blocks that maintains respect for the natural landscape;
natural features and undisturbed areas that are incorporated into the open space of the neighborhood;
a coordinated transportation system with a hierarchy of appropriately designed facilities for pedestrians, bicycles, public transit, and automotive
vehicles;
well-configured squares, plazas, greens, landscaped streets, preserves, greenbelts, and parks woven into the pattern of the neighborhood and
dedicated to the collective social activity, recreation, and visual enjoyment of the populace;
civic buildings, open spaces, and other visual features that act as landmarks, symbols, and focal points for community identity;
compatibility of buildings and other improvements as determined by their arrangement, bulk, form, character, and landscaping to establish a livable,
harmonious, and diverse environment;
private buildings that form a consistent, distinct edge and define the border between the public street space and the private block interior; and
architecture and landscape that respond to the unique character of the region.

§ 25-3-3 - OVERVIEW.
A traditional neighborhood district consists of an area of not less than 40 contiguous acres and not more than 250 contiguous acres. In this chapter,
property is considered contiguous even if separated by a public roadway.
A traditional neighborhood district is divided into at least two types of Areas, and each type of Area has different land use and site development
regulations. A traditional neighborhood district must have one Neighborhood Center Area and at least one Mixed Residential Area. A traditional
neighborhood district may also have a Neighborhood Edge Area, a Workshop Area, or an Employment Center Area.
A Neighborhood Center Area serves as the focal point of a traditional neighborhood district, containing retail, commercial, civic, and public services to
meet the daily needs of community residents. A Neighborhood Center is pedestrian-oriented, and it is designed to encourage pedestrian movement
between a Mixed Residential Area and a Neighborhood Center Area. A square is required in a Neighborhood Center Area. Retail and commercial uses
should generally be located adjacent to a square. Neighborhood Center Area uses include retail shops, restaurants, offices, banks, hotels, post office,
governmental offices, churches, community centers, and attached residential dwellings.
A Mixed Residential Area includes a variety of residential land uses including single-family residential, duplex, townhouse, and multi-family. Residential
scale retail and commercial uses are permitted within a Mixed Residential area with strict architectural and land use controls. Retail and commercial uses
in a Mixed Residential area are required to blend into the residential character of the neighborhood. A Mixed Residential area includes open spaces
including small squares, pocket parks, community parks, and greenbelts. A Mixed Residential Area promotes pedestrian activity through well designed
and varied streetscapes that also provide for the safe and efficient movement of vehicular traffic. Mixed Residential Area uses include single-family
homes, condominiums, townhouses, apartments, offices, restaurants, neighborhood scale retail, and civic uses.
A Neighborhood Edge Area is the least dense portion of a traditional neighborhood district, with larger lots and greater setbacks than the rest of the
neighborhood. Alleys are not required, and direct vehicular access to the street is permitted. Only single family residential dwellings are permitted. A
Neighborhood Edge Area is appropriate along the perimeter of the neighborhood. A portion of a traditional neighborhood district that adjoins existing or
platted conventional low density housing must be designated as a Neighborhood Edge Area.
A traditional neighborhood district may have a Workshop Area, an Employment Center Area, or both. Commercial and light industrial uses that are not
appropriate for a Neighborhood Center Area or a Mixed Residential Area but which serve the local residents may be located in a Workshop Area. Large
office and low-impact manufacturing uses may be located within an Employment Center Area. The scale and architectural conventions of a traditional
neighborhood district apply to a Workshop area and an Employment Center Area.
Civic uses that are oriented to the general public are permitted in a Neighborhood Center Area and a Mixed Residential Area. These uses are essential
components of the social and physical fabric of a traditional neighborhood district. Special attention should be paid to the location of government offices,
libraries, museums, schools, churches, and other prominent public buildings to create focal points and landmarks for the community. The locations of
these major public civic uses are designated on the Development Plan at the time of zoning approval.
Open space is a significant part of a traditional neighborhood district design. Formal and informal open spaces are required. These serve as areas for
community gatherings, landmarks, and as organizing elements for the neighborhood. Open space includes squares, plazas, greens, preserves, parks, and
greenbelts.
A traditional neighborhood district is designed to be pedestrian oriented. To accomplish this goal, street pattern and design is used to reduce vehicle
travel speeds and encourage pedestrian activity. An interconnected network of streets and alleys is required. Streets may be smaller than in conventional
development and more varied in size and form to control traffic and give character to the neighborhood.

ARTICLE 3. - SUBDIVISION.
§ 25-3-51 - SUBDIVISION PROCEDURE.
The subdivision procedures in Chapter 25-4 (Subdivision) apply to the traditional neighborhood district, except as follows:
All property within a traditional neighborhood district must be subdivided under this chapter. A previously approved final subdivision plat must be
vacated, and a previously approved preliminary subdivision plan must be withdrawn.
The traditional neighborhood district shall be on one preliminary subdivision plan.
An open space area shall be included in the final subdivision plat of adjacent property. All open space areas must be platted as separate open space
lots.
A final subdivision plat may not be approved unless there has been compliance with the provisions of this chapter relating to a Property Owners'
Association, Architectural Standards, Land Use Allocations, Drainage, and Water Quality.
A final subdivision plat for more than 50 percent of the land area covered by the preliminary subdivision plan may not be approved until construction
of the community meeting hall has begun. Once begun, the construction of the community meeting hall must be diligently pursued to completion.
Improvements to private open spaces, except those included in a construction phasing plan for major private open space improvements, shall be
constructed by the subdivider as part of the subdivision infrastructure.
Source: Section 13-9-31; Ord. 990225-70; Ord. 031211-11.
§ 25-3-52 - SUBDIVISION LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS.
Street monuments and property markers.
Property pins or other forms of permanent markers identified in the most recent edition of the Manual of Practice for Land Surveying in Texas,
published by the Texas Society of Professional Surveyors, shall be placed by the surveyor at all corners of boundary lines of a subdivision. Pins and
markers may not be spaced more than 1,300 feet apart. One corner of the subdivision shall be identified by a concrete monument unless a concrete
monument exists on an adjacent platted subdivision within 1,300 feet of the proposed plat.
If a concrete monument exists on an adjacent platted subdivision within 1,300 feet of the proposed plat, no concrete monuments are required for the
proposed plat. In that instance, boundary corners may be set with permanent markers identified in the most recent edition of Manual of Practice for
Land Surveying in Texas.
Intermediate property corners, curve points, and angle points shall be marked by iron stakes.
Easements for public utilities and enclosed or open drainage ways shall be retained in all subdivisions in the widths and locations deemed necessary by
the director. To the extent practicable, the easements for water lines, wastewater lines, and storm sewers shall be located in the street rights-of-way, and
the easements for all other utilities shall be located in the alley rights-of-way. All the easements shall be dedicated to public use for the named purpose
and shall be aligned to minimize construction cost.
Utilities shall be located underground unless this requirement is, for good cause, waived by the director, and, if applicable, the director of the Electric
Utility Department.
When the director finds that easements in areas adjoining a proposed subdivision are necessary to provide adequate drainage or to serve the subdivision
with utilities, the subdivider shall obtain the easements or make arrangements with the City to obtain them.
Streets of new subdivisions shall be aligned with existing streets on adjoining property unless the Land Use Commission determines that the
Comprehensive Plan, topography, requirements of traffic circulation, or other considerations make it desirable to depart from the alignment.
Each lot in a subdivision, except a lot that fronts on a plaza and abuts an alley, shall abut a dedicated public street.

Except in a Neighborhood Edge Area, each lot in a subdivision shall abut an alley unless the director determines that good cause exists to omit an alley or
portion of an alley.
An interconnected network of streets is required unless the director determines that good cause exists to require a different street pattern.
Streets, alleys, and pedestrian paths shall be designed and constructed in accordance with this chapter, the Traditional Neighborhood District Criteria
Manual, the Standards Criteria Manual, and the Standard Specifications Criteria Manual.
New streets in subdivisions shall be named to provide continuity of name with existing streets and to prevent conflict with identical or similarly spelled or
pronounced names in other parts of the city's planning jurisdiction.
Street intersections, whether public or private streets, shall be designed in accordance with the provisions of the Traditional Neighborhood District
Criteria Manual and the Transportation Criteria Manual.
Dead-end streets are prohibited unless the director determines that the most desirable plan requires laying out a dead-end street. A dead-end street
shall terminate in a courtyard designed in accordance with the Traditional Neighborhood District Criteria Manual, unless the director determines that
topography, density, adequate circulation, or other unusual conditions require a deviation from the design criteria in the Traditional Neighborhood
District Criteria Manual.
The side lines of lots in subdivisions shall be approximately at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines. An arrangement placing
adjacent lots at right angles to each other shall be avoided.
Block length may not exceed 600 feet. Block width may not exceed 300 feet. The director may approve a block width of not more than 400 feet or a block
length of not more than 1000 feet if required because of topography or existing street layout, but a block longer than 800 feet must be traversed by a
pedestrian path near the midpoint.
Minimum lot size, maximum lot size, and minimum lot width are specified in the site development regulations contained in this chapter for a
Neighborhood Center Area, a Mixed Residential Area, a Neighborhood Edge Area, a Workshop Area, and an Employment Center Area. Open space lots
must comply with the dimensional requirements of this chapter.
Townhouse lots may be created where each townhouse lot is to be served by a public sewage system, subject to the following conditions in addition to
those applicable to all other subdivisions:
All common areas shall be clearly identified on the plat and adequate provisions made for maintenance and taxation.
There may be not less than two and not more than eight units in a townhouse group.
Not more than one townhouse may be located on a lot.
A legal opinion by an attorney licensed to practice law in the state, accurately describing and defining the rights and duties of the owners, the legal
status of common areas and facilities, and provisions for taxation and maintenance of the common areas, must accompany each subdivision with
townhouse lots.

controls, are as follows:
For a Neighborhood Center Area:
Townhouse, condominium, and multi-family uses shall be allocated not less than 20 percent of the land area.
Commercial uses shall be allocated not less than 20 percent of the land area.
Civic use shall be allocated not less than five percent of the land area, or one-half acre, whichever is greater. In a traditional neighborhood district
of 100 acres or less, the provision of a community meeting hall in the Neighborhood Center satisfies the civic use allocation even if less than one-
half acre is used.
For a Mixed Residential Area:
Single family residential use shall be allocated not less than 50 percent and not more than 80 percent of the land area.
Duplex use shall be allocated not more than 10 percent of the land area.

Civic uses shall be allocated not less than two percent of the land area.
A preliminary subdivision plan may not be approved until the director approves a Land Use Allocation Map, submitted by the owner, that allocates a
particular land use category to each lot on the preliminary subdivision plan.
Development and use shall comply with the Land Use Allocation Map.
The director may approve a revision to a Land Use Allocation Map if the director finds that (a) the revised land uses are appropriate, and (b) the revision
does not adversely affect land owners within 200 feet of the boundary line of a revised area.
A Land Use Allocation Map and the land use allocations required by this section are effective for a period of 50 years after the date the map is first
approved by the director.

Source: Ord. 20080214-096.
§ 25-6-354 - PAYMENT INSTEAD OF SIDEWALK INSTALLATION.
An applicant may request to pay a fee instead of installing a sidewalk by filing a written request at the time the person submits a permit application in the
manner prescribed by the director. An applicant who has not filed a request at the time of application, may later amend the application to request to pay
fee instead of installing a sidewalk.
For a sidewalk required under Section 25-6-353 (Sidewalk Installation with Building or Relocation Permit), the director shall approve payment of a fee
instead of installation of a sidewalk if the director determines that:
the property is used only for a residential use and has not more than two dwelling units;
on the date the property was subdivided, the land development regulations did not include a sidewalk requirement; and
less than 50 percent of the block face on which the property is located has a sidewalk.
For a sidewalk required under Section 25-6-351 (Sidewalk Installation in Subdivisions), the director shall approve payment of a fee instead of installation
of a sidewalk if the subdivision:
consists of five or fewer lots;
only includes residential lots, each of which contains no more than two dwelling units;
is a resubdivision of land that was originally subdivided on a date when applicable regulations did not include a sidewalk requirement; and
less than 50 percent of the block face on which the property is located has a sidewalk.
The director may approve payment of a fee instead of installation of a sidewalk if the director determines that installation is impractical because:
there are no sidewalks in the vicinity, and it is unlikely that there will be development nearby that would require the installation of sidewalks;

development (PUD) that includes specific off-site parking requirements controls over this article.
A minimum of one on-site accessible space is required. The minimum number of accessible spaces is calculated by taking 100 percent of the parking
previously required for the use under Appendix A (Tables of Off-Street Loading Requirements and Former Off-Street Parking Requirements) and using
that result to determine the number of accessible parking spaces required under the Building Code.
If an applicant provides an off-street parking facility for a building or use, accessible spaces must be provided on-site.
If an applicant provides only accessible spaces for a use:
Accessible spaces may be located on- or off-site, within 250 feet of the use, and must be on an accessible route.
An off-site or on-street accessible space that is located within 250 feet of a use may be counted towards the number of required accessible spaces
under Subsection (B).
The director may waive or reduce the number of accessible space required if no accessible spaces can be provided consistent with the requirements
of Paragraph (D)(1).
The accessible space parking requirement for a site with more than one use or for adjacent sites served by a common parking facility is the cumulative
total of spaces required for each site or use.
In this section:
QUALIFYING DEVELOPMENT means a development certified under Section 25-1-724 (Certification) and participating in the Affordability Unlocked
Bonus Program.
A qualifying development is not required to comply with Appendix A of Chapter 25-6 (Transportation) but must comply with this section.
The minimum number of required off-street accessible spaces is the greater of:
one accessible parking space;
the number of accessible spaces required under the Building Code based on 100 percent of the parking previously required for the use under
Appendix A (Tables of Off-Street Loading Requirements and Former Off-Street Parking Requirements); or
the number of accessible spaces required under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or the Fair Housing Act Amendments (FHAA), as
appropriate.
An accessible space must be adjacent to the site and on an accessible route.
An accessible parking space must comply with design, accessibility, and location requirements imposed by the ADA and the FFHA, as appropriate.
Accessible parking detailed in Subsection (G)(1) must be provided off-street except insofar as on-street or off-site parking is allowed elsewhere in this
title.

§ 25-6-472 - PARKING FACILITY STANDARDS.
Except as provided in Section 25-6-473 (Modification of Parking Requirement), a parking facility for a use must comply with the requirements in Section
25-6-471 (Off-Street Parking) and Appendix A (Tables of Off-Street Loading Requirements and Former Off-Street Parking Requirements), as applicable.
A parking facility must:
be maintained for the duration of the use or existence of the building requiring the facility; and
be used exclusively for the temporary parking of passenger automobiles, motor vehicles, or light trucks not exceeding one ton in capacity.
A parking facility requirement is based on gross floor area of a building or use served by the facility. For the purpose of calculating parking requirements,
gross floor area does not include enclosed or covered areas used for off-street parking or loading, bicycle storage rooms or shower facilities.
The parking facility requirement for a general retail service use in a shopping center is based on the gross floor area of the entire shopping center,
including portions not used for a general retail use. The parking requirement for a use in a shopping center other than a general retail service use is
based on the rate for the use.
Except in the central business district (CBD) or a downtown mixed use (DMU) zoning district, an outdoor seating area for a restaurant (general) or a
cocktail lounge use must be included with the gross floor area to determine the parking requirement.
If a calculation under Appendix A (Tables of Off-Street Loading Requirements and Former Off-Street Parking Requirements) results in a fractional
requirement, a fraction of 0.5 or greater is rounded to the next larger whole number.
If a parking facility requirement is based on seating or capacity, occupancy is determined as prescribed in Chapter 25-12 (Uniform Building Code).
Head-in parking is prohibited in a townhouse and condominium residential (SF-6) or less restrictive zoning district.

§ 25-6-476 - BICYCLE PARKING FOR MIXED USE DEVELOPMENTS.
The bicycle parking requirement for a site with more than one use or for adjacent sites served by a common parking facility is the cumulative total of
spaces required for each site or use, unless otherwise provided by this section.
A person may request an adjustment to the bicycle parking requirement for separate uses located on one site or for separate uses located on adjoining
or nearby sites and served by a common parking facility.
To apply for an adjustment under this section, an applicant must submit to the director a site plan and transportation engineering report addressing the
following:
the characteristics of each use and the differences in projected peak parking demand, including days or hours of operation;
potential reduction in vehicle movements resulting from the multi-purpose use of the parking facility by employees, customers, or residents of the
uses served;
potential improvements in parking facility design, circulation, and access resulting from a joint parking facility;
compliance with shared parking guidelines in the Transportation Criteria Manual; and
detail the amount of bicycle parking to be provided.

Off-street motor vehicle parking is not required within the central business district (CBD) or downtown mixed use (DMU) zoning districts except as
provided by this subsection. For purposes of this subsection, off-street parking includes any parking that is designated to serve a use and is not located in
a public right-of-way, regardless of whether the parking is onsite or offsite.
Editor's note—Amendments to division (B) of this section made by Ord. 20130523-104 did not take into account amendments previously made by Ord. 20130411-
061. The amendments enacted by Ord. 20130523-104 have therefore been made only to other parts of the section that do not conflict with Ord. 20130411-061.
Future legislation will correct the text if needed.
If off-street parking is provided, it must include parking for persons with disabilities as required by the Building Code and may not include fewer
accessible spaces than would be required under Paragraph (2)(a) of this subsection.
Except for a use occupying a designated historic landmark or an existing building in a designated historic district, off-street motor vehicle parking for
persons with disabilities must be provided for a use that occupies 6,000 square feet or more of floor space under the requirements of this paragraph.
The following requirements apply if no parking is provided for a use, other than parking for persons with disabilities:
the minimum number of accessible parking spaces is calculated by taking 100 percent of the parking previously required for the use under
Appendix A (Tables of Off-Street Loading Requirements and Former Off-Street Parking Requirements) and using that result to determine the
number of accessible spaces required under the Building Code. The accessible spaces may be provided on- or off-site, within 250 feet of the
use and must be on an accessible route.
The director may waive or reduce the number of accessible spaces required under Paragraph (2)(a)(i) if the applicant pays a fee in-lieu to be
used by the city to construct and maintain accessible parking in the vicinity of the use. The availability of this option is contingent on the
establishment of a fee by separate ordinance and the adoption of a program by the director to administer the fee and establish eligibility
criteria. A decision by the director that a use is ineligible for a fee in-lieu is final.
The director may waive or reduce the number of accessible spaces required if no accessible spaces can be provided consistent with the
requirements of Paragraph (2)(a)(i) and the use is ineligible for participation in the fee in-lieu program under Paragraph (2)(a)(ii).
An off-site or on-street parking space designated for persons with disabilities that is located within 250 feet of a use may be counted towards
the number of parking spaces the use is required to provide under Paragraph (2)(a)(i).
If any off-street parking is provided for a use, other than parking for persons with disabilities, then the use is subject to the requirements in
Paragraph (1).
Except as provided in Subsections (C) and (F), the maximum motor vehicle parking facility allowed is 60 percent of the number of motor vehicle
parking spaces previously required by Appendix A (Tables of Off-Street Loading Requirements and Former Off-Street Parking Requirements).
Except as provided in Subsections (C) and (D) of this section, a parking garage must be separated from an adjacent street by a pedestrian-oriented use
described in Section 25-2-691 (Waterfront Overlay (WO) District Uses) that fronts on the street at the ground level.
A curb cut for a garage access must have a width of 30 feet or less.
At the intersection of sidewalk and parking access lane, ten degree cones of vision are required.
The maximum number of parking spaces allowed under Subsection (B)(3) of this section may be increased at the request of an applicant under the
requirements of this subsection.
The director shall approve an increase if all parking spaces are contained in a parking structure and the total number of spaces is less than 110
percent of the spaces calculated under Appendix A (Tables of Off-Street Loading Requirements and Former Off-Street Parking Requirements).
Only if bicycle parking is also increased proportionately.
The Land Use Commission may waive the requirement of Subsection (B)(5) of this section during the site plan review process after determining that:
present and anticipated development in the area is not amenable to access by pedestrians;
the requirement does not allow a reasonable use of the property; or
other circumstances attributable to the property make compliance impractical.
If a waiver is granted under Subsection (D), an area for which the requirement is waived must be screened.
This subsection applies to property zoned CBD and DMU.
Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the maximum number of motor vehicle parking spaces allowed is 40 percent of the number of motor
vehicle parking spaces formerly required by Appendix A (Tables of Off-Street Parking and Loading Requirements).
A development that is les than 10,000 square feet in floor area or containing 70 or fewer residential units can include up to 60 percent of motor
vehicle parking spaces formerly required by Appendix A (Tables of Off-Street Parking and Loading Requirements).
The maximum number of motor vehicle parking spaces allowed is 80 percent of the number of motor vehicle parking spaces formerly required by
Appendix A (Tables of Off-Street Loading Requirements and Former Off-Street Parking Requirements) if:
all parking spaces are contained in a parking structure;
the director finds that allowing additional parking spaces does not impact public health, safety, or welfare or undermine established planning
policies for the area; and

§ 25-6-592 - LOADING FACILITY PROVISIONS FOR THE CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT (CBD) AND A DOWNTOWN MIXED USE (DMU) AND PUBLIC (P) ZONING DISTRICTS.
This section applies to a site zoned central business district (CBD) or downtown mixed use (DMU), and public (P) zoning district within the area bounded
by Martin Luther King, Jr., Boulevard; IH-35; Lady Bird Lake; and Lamar Boulevard, except for:
a building with a gross floor area of not more than 10,000 square feet; or
the renovation of an existing structure, if the director determines that there is not enough space on the site to comply with the requirements of this
section.
The following must be located on-site in accordance with this section:
a trash receptacle location; and
an off-street loading facility.
For a site that is adjacent to an alley:
the off-street loading facility and trash receptacle location must be accessible from the alley; and
the use of the alley for loading or unloading is a permitted use.
For a site that is not adjacent to an alley:
a curb cut for an off-street loading facility or trash receptacle location may not exceed 30 feet in width;
a vehicle may not use a public right-of-way to back into or out of an off-street loading facility or trash receptacle location; and
the off-street loading facility and trash receptacle location:
must be accessible from a street other than Congress Avenue or Sixth Street;
may not be visible from a street, except at a curb cut; and
must be at least 30 feet deep, measured from the front setback line or side setback line as applicable.
The Land Use Commission may waive a requirement of Subsection (C) or (D) after determining that:
waiving the requirement does not create a hazard to pedestrians or vehicles; and
for a waiver of Subsection (D)(3)(b), the applicant has reduced the visibility of the off-street loading facility and trash location to the greatest extent
possible.
The minimum number of loading spaces for development in the CBD or a DMU zoning district is listed on the schedule at the end of Section 25-6-592
(Loading Facility Provisions for the Central Business District (CBD) and a Downtown Mixed Use (DMU) and Public (P) Zoning Districts). For civic uses, the
number of loading spaces required shall be determined by the Director. For all other uses not listed in the table contained at the end of Section 25-6-592,
the requirements of Appendix A, Part 1 apply.
Multiple uses or occupancies located in a single building or on one site may be served by a common loading space, if the Director determines that the
loading space can adequately serve each use.
The Director may modify the number and size of spaces required after reviewing documentation provided by the applicant concerning the demand for
loading facilities for similar developments.

§ 25-6-656 - BICYCLE PARKING FUND.
An applicant may request to pay a fee instead of installing bicycle parking by filing a written request at the time the person submits a permit application in
the manner prescribed by the director. An applicant who has not filed a request at the time of application, may later amend the application to request to
pay the fee instead of installing a bicycle parking.
Fund use and administration. The Bicycle Parking Fund is collected and administered by the Public Works Department - Neighborhood Connectivity
Division. The funds collected will be used to install bicycle parking and associated improvements in the right-of-way in the same service area as the
subject property in the application. The service area boundaries shall be determined by the Planning and Development Review Department.
For bicycle parking required under Section 25-6-477 (Bicycle Parking), the director shall approve payment of a fee instead of installation of a bicycle
parking space if the director determines that:
on the date the property was subdivided, the land development regulations did not include a bicycle parking requirement; and
there is not sufficient area on or in the premises to accommodate the minimum required bicycle parking; and
more than 50 percent of the block face on which the property is located has available space for bicycle parking.
The director may approve payment of a fee instead of installation of bicycle parking if the director determines that installation is impractical because:
installation of the bicycle parking would require the removal of a protected tree or other major obstruction within the right-of-way; or
other unusual circumstances make the bicycle parking installation requirement unreasonable or inappropriate.
The amount of the fee is the current bicycle parking materials and installation cost and will be determined by Administrative Rule.
A fee paid under this section must be used to install bicycle parking in the same service area, as established by the Administrative Rules.
The City may refund the fee to the applicant if it is not spent or allocated for a specific project within 10 years of the date of its collection.

§ 25-6-662 - ASSESSMENT OF STREET IMPACT FEES.
Assessment of the street impact fee for any new development shall occur:
on December 21, 2020, if the final plat approval occurred before December 21, 2020;
at the time of final plat approval if the development has not received plat approval; or
at the time an application is submitted for a building permit for development that is exempted from platting under Section 25-4-2 (Exemption from
Platting Requirements).
For a development that has been assessed a street impact fee under Section 25-6-662(A)(1), the street impact fee shall be reassessed if the owner
submits a new application for plat approval.
An application for an amended plat shall not be subject to reassessment for an impact fee.
All assessments of street impact fees shall be the amount of the maximum street impact fee per service unit as set forth in adopted street impact fee
study in effect.
The amount of the maximum street impact fee for a new development, less any applicable percentage reduction in fees attributable to internal recapture,
transit proximity, or parking management techniques under Section 25-6-667 (Mobility Related Reductions), may be considered by the director's
designated engineer as an appropriate measure of the new development's demand for roadway system facilities under Section 25-6-23 (Proportionality of
Required Infrastructure). The amount of street impact fees assessed may be used in evaluating any claim by an applicant that the infrastructure
improvements required in conjunction with approval of the development application are not roughly proportionate to the proposed development. To the
extent that the street impact fee collected from a new development is less than the maximum impact fee per service unit, except for reductions under
Section 25-6-667 (Mobility Related Reductions), such difference hereby is declared to be founded on policies unrelated to measurement of the impacts of
the new development on the City's roadway system.

§ 25-6-663 - AMOUNT OF FEE: COLLECTION RATE.
The amount of the street impact fee to be assessed for each service unit and the amount of the street impact fee to be collected for each service unit
shall be set by separate ordinance. The street impact fee to be collected may be increased by ordinance prior to the next scheduled street impact fee
update without amending the street impact fee study, provided that the impact fee to be collected does not exceed the street impact fee that was
assessed.
A street impact fee shall be collected at the time of the issuance of a building permit.
The city manager may enter into an agreement with a developer for a different time and manner of payment of street impact fees.
Source: Ord. No. 20201210-062, Pt. 2, 12-21-20.
§ 25-6-664 - COMPUTATION OF IMPACT FEES TO BE COLLECTED.
The City shall compute the amount of street impact fees to be paid and collected for new development in the following manner:
Determine the number of development units for each land use category using the LUVMET then in effect.
Multiply the number of development units for each land use category in the new development by the service unit for each corresponding land use
category in the LUVMET to determine the number of service units attributable to the new development.
Multiply the number of service units for the new development by the street impact fee per service unit to be collected for the applicable service area
and applicable land use.
If an agreement as described in City Code Section 25-6-669 (Offsets Against Street Impact Fees) providing for offsets exists, the amount of the offsets shall
be deducted from the street impact fees as calculated above.
If the applicant proposes to increase the number of service units for a development that has already paid a street impact fee, the additional street impact
fees collected for such new service units shall be determined by using the LUVMET.
Any additional street impact fees shall be measured by the increase in the number of service units proposed from the number of service units from the
preceding land use within the last five years.

An applicant who complies with the requirements of this section may request a 100 percent reduction of the street impact fee for all service units that
meet the requirements in Subsection (B).
To be eligible for a reduction under this section, affordable housing must be a housing unit located within the corporate limits of the City that is:
approved for local, state, or federal funding for affordable housing as verified by the director of the Housing and Planning Department; or
certified by the director of the Housing and Planning Department under another affordable housing program of City Code that meets the
requirements of this section.
To retain a reduction under this section, a unit of affordable housing must comply with the requirements of this subsection.
A rental unit must be available for occupancy for a period of not less than 40 years by an occupant whose gross household income does not exceed
60 percent of the median family income for the Austin Metropolitan Statistical Area.
An owner-occupied unit must be available for occupancy for a period of not less than 99 years by an occupant whose gross household income does
not exceed 80 percent of the median family income for the Austin Metropolitan Statistical Area.
An affordability period prescribed by this subsection begins on the date that an affordable unit is available for occupancy.
An applicant who requests a reduction under this section must submit an application to the director of the Housing and Planning Department
demonstrating compliance.
If the director of the Housing and Planning Department certifies that a proposed development meets the requirements of this division, the accountable
official is authorized to process a development application.
Before the director of the Housing and Planning Department may certify that a proposed development meets the requirements of this section, the
applicant shall execute:
an agreement to preserve the minimum affordability period and related requirements imposed by this division; and
a document for recording in the real property records that provides notice of or preserves the minimum affordability requirements imposed by this
division.
The form of the documents described in this section must be approved by the city attorney.
If an applicant who receives a reduction under this section does not comply with Subsection (B), defaults on its obligations under documents executed
under Subsection (C), or does not perform in accordance with the conditions for receipt of the reduction, the City may initiate legal proceedings to
recover the street impact fees that would have applied to the housing unit and damages.
A reduction under this section may not be assigned or transferred by the applicant to another property.
Source: Ord. No. 20201210-062, Pt. 2, 12-21-20.
§ 25-6-669 - OFFSETS AGAINST STREET IMPACT FEES.
The City may offset the improvements or funding for construction of any system facility included on the roadway capacity plan that is required or agreed
to by the City under this section and administrative guidelines.
The roadway facility shall be associated with the plat or other detailed plan of development for the property that is to be served by the roadway
facility.
No offset shall be given for the dedication, funding, or construction of site-related facilities.
No offset shall be given for a roadway facility which is not identified within the roadway capacity plan unless the system facility qualifies for inclusion
on the roadway capacity plan and is incorporated within an allocation agreement with the City under Subsection (D).
The value of any offset for a system facility shall be reduced by the City's cost participation in the construction or funding of such facility.
If the amount of the offsets for a new development exceeds the total amount of street impact fees due for the development, the remaining amount of
the offsets may not be transferred or assigned to other new developments for which street impact fees are due, nor is the City responsible for
reimbursing the property owner for such remaining amount, unless an allocation agreement under Subsection (D) expressly so provides.
No offsets shall be granted for the onsite dedication of rights-of-way or easements required by this chapter. Onsite dedication of rights-of-way or
easements for roadway system facilities may be considered in determining the development's share of roadway infrastructure improvement costs under
Section 25-6-23 (Proportionality of Required Infrastructure).
Construction of capital improvements must be completed and accepted by the City in order to qualify as an offset with the following limitations:
Construction completed and accepted before December 21, 2020, will only qualify as an offset until December 21, 2030.
Construction that begins after December 21, 2020, will qualify as an offset for ten years from the date the improvement is completed and accepted by
the City unless the applicant is granted an extension.
Before street impact fees can be reduced by offsets authorized under this section, the owner of the property shall enter into an agreement with the City
determining the allocation of the offsets. Unless the allocation agreement specifies otherwise, an offset associated with a plat shall be applied when the
first building permit is submitted and to each subsequent building permit application to reduce street impact fees due until the amount associated with
the offset is exhausted.

Master planned projects, including subdivisions containing multiple phases, whether approved before or after the effective date of the street impact fee
regulations, may apply for offsets against street impact fees for the entire project based upon improvements or funds toward construction of system
facilities. For projects where development has already occurred, the amount of any offset shall be reduced by the value attributable to any service units
for which a building permit has been issued prior to one year from the effective date of this article. Offsets shall be spent within the same service area
using a methodology approved by the City and incorporated within an agreement under Subsection (D).
For new development that consists of multiple phases, the City may require that total offsets be proportionally allocated among phases within the new
development.

ARTICLE 2. - DRAINAGE STUDIES; EROSION HAZARD ANALYSIS; FLOODPLAIN DELINEATION.
§ 25-7-31 - REQUIREMENT FOR DRAINAGE STUDIES.
For a preliminary plan or plat application to demonstrate that the proposed development would not result in an adverse impact to adjacent properties,
the director may require the owner of real property to provide, at the owner's expense, a drainage study for the total area to be developed to
demonstrate compliance with applicable drainage regulations.
For all other applications, the director may require the owner of real property to provide, at the owner's expense and as a condition for development
application approval, a drainage study for the total area to be ultimately developed.
The drainage study must be in accordance with the Drainage Criteria Manual.
If a drainage study is required under this section, the City may not accept for review a development application for any portion of the proposed
development until the director has received the required drainage study.
Source: Ord. 20131017-046; Ord. No. 20230831-141, Pt. 43, 9-11-23.
§ 25-7-32 - EROSION HAZARD ZONE ANALYSIS REQUIREMENT.
For a preliminary plan or plat application to demonstrate that the development proposed in a preliminary plan or plat application does not create
negative erosion impacts, the owner of real property may provide, at the owner's expense, an erosion hazard zone analysis.
An erosion hazard analysis is not required for:
a minor, unoccupied residential appurtenance to a residential use;
a hard-surfaced trail located between 100 and 200 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the Colorado River downstream from Longhorn Dam, as
defined by Code of Federal Regulations Title 33, Section 328.3 (Definitions); or
development on a property separated from the triggering waterway by a public roadway.
For all other development applications, the director may require the owner of real property to provide, at the owner's expense and as a condition for
development application approval, an analysis to establish the erosion hazard zone if the proposed development is:
within 100 feet of the centerline of a waterway with a drainage area of 64 acres or greater;
within 100 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the Colorado River downstream from Longhorn Dam, as defined by Code of Federal Regulations
Title 33, Section 328.3 (Definitions) and is proposing to add, remodel, or reconstruct a:
single-family residential use,
duplex residential use,
two-unit residential use, or
three-unit residential use.
within 100 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the Colorado River downstream from Longhorn Dam, as defined by Code of Federal Regulations
Title 33, Section 328.3 (Definitions) and a residential building permit for a manufactured home;
within 200 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the Colorado River downstream from Longhorn Dam, as defined by Code of Federal Regulations
Title 33, Section 328.3 (Definitions); or
located where significant erosion is present.
The erosion hazard zone analysis must be in accordance with the Drainage Criteria Manual.
If an erosion hazard zone analysis is required under this section, the City may not accept for review a development application for any portion of the
proposed development until the director has received the required erosion hazard zone analysis.

ARTICLE 3. - REQUIREMENTS FOR APPROVAL.
§ 25-7-61 - CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL OF DEVELOPMENT APPLICATIONS.
A development application may not be approved unless:
the proposed development application demonstrates sufficient capacity for the design flood, as determined under the Drainage Criteria Manual;
each proposed improvement is sufficiently strong to resist:
external pressure caused by earth or building; and
internal pressure or abrasion caused by water or debris;
the proposed grades will not permit water to gather in a pool that may become stagnant, excluding variable pools in creek beds as a result of natural
channel design;
temporary and permanent measures to control erosion are sufficient to minimize siltation of the waterway, as determined under the Environmental
Criteria Manual; and
the proposed development:
will not result in additional adverse flooding impact on other property;
to the greatest extent feasible, preserves the natural and traditional character of the land and the waterway located within the 100-year
floodplain;
except as provided by Subsection (B), includes on-site control of the two-year peak flow, as determined under the Drainage Criteria Manual and
the Environmental Criteria Manual;
will not result in additional erosion impacts on other property; and
locates all proposed improvements outside the erosion hazard zone, unless protective works are provided as prescribed in the Drainage Criteria
Manual.
A proposed development may provide off-site control of the two-year peak flow, if the off-site control will not cause:
an adverse water quality impact from increased in-stream peak flow; or
streambank erosion.

§ 25-7-151 - STORMWATER CONVEYANCE AND DRAINAGE FACILITIES.
The owner or developer of property to be developed is responsible for the conveyance of all stormwater flowing through the property, including
stormwater that:
is directed to the property by other developed property; or
naturally flows through the property because of the topography.
Future upstream development shall be accounted for as determined under the Drainage Criteria Manual.
If the construction or improvement of a storm drainage facility is required along a property line that is common to more than one property owner, the
owner proposing to develop the property is, at the time the property is developed, responsible for each required facility on either side of the common
property line.
The responsibility of the owner proposing to develop the property includes the responsibility to dedicate or obtain the dedication of any right-of-way or
easement necessary to accommodate the required construction or improvement of the storm drainage facility.
If an owner of property proposes to develop only a portion of that property, a stormwater drainage facility to serve that portion of the property proposed
for immediate development or use is required, unless the director determines that construction or improvement of a drainage facility outside that
portion of the property to be developed is essential to the development or use of the property to be developed.
The owner or developer shall provide adequate off-site drainage improvements to accommodate the full effects of the development. The city may assist
the owner or developer in the acquisition of an interest in property necessary to provide an off-site improvement, if the owner or developer:
by affidavit, certifies that a bona fide attempt to provide the off-site drainage improvements has not been successful; and
provides an adequate guarantee that the owner or developer will:
finance the entire cost of acquiring the necessary property interest; and
retain full responsibility for construction of the required off-site improvement.
Source: Ord. 20131017-046.
§ 25-7-152 - DEDICATION OF EASEMENTS AND RIGHTS-OF-WAY.
The owner of real property proposed to be developed shall dedicate to the public an easement or right-of way for a drainage facility, open or enclosed,
and stormwater flow to the limits of the 100-year floodplain, as prescribed in the Drainage Criteria Manual.
An easement or right-of-way required by Subsection (A) must be of sufficient width to provide continuous access for the operation, maintenance, or
repair of a drainage facility as prescribed in the Drainage Criteria Manual.
The owner of the property shall dedicate any additional easement or right-of-way that is necessary to allow continuous access for the operation,
maintenance, or rehabilitation of a drainage facility.
A part of a lot or tract of land that is located in an easement or right-of-way required by this section may be included as part of the area of the lot or tract
of land in the calculation of density or impervious cover.
For property in the full-purpose limits of the city, the director may grant a variance to Subsection (A) if the director determines:
development with the variance does not result in additional adverse flooding of other property; and
the development:
is permitted by a variance granted under Section 25-7-92(C) (Encroachments on Floodplain Prohibited);
is permitted in a floodplain under Section 25-7-93 (General Exceptions), Section 25-7-94 (Exceptions in Central Business Area), Section 25-7-95
(Exceptions for Parking Areas), or Section 25-7-96 (Exceptions in the 25-Year Floodplain);
is not a building or parking area; or
is a non-conforming use, as defined by Chapter 25-12, Article 3 (Flood Hazard Areas).

The record owner of a commercial development shall maintain the commercial basin serving the commercial development in accordance with the DCM standards,
whether or not the commercial basin is located on the same property as the commercial development. The record owner shall provide the City proof of the right to
access and maintain the commercial basin if it is not located on the same property as the commercial development.
If more than one commercial development is served by a single commercial basin, the record owners of the commercial basin and all commercial
developments served by the commercial basin shall be jointly and severally responsible for maintenance of the commercial basin in accordance with the
DCM standards.
The director may authorize an alternative arrangement for maintenance of a residential or commercial basin in accordance with the DCM standards. If an
alternative arrangement is approved by the director, the City Attorney shall determine whether an agreement is necessary; the agreement must be
approved by the City Attorney and filed of record.
The City shall inspect each commercial basin that is not a subsurface basin at least once every three years to ensure that the commercial basin is being
maintained in accordance with the DCM standards. If the commercial basin fails inspection requiring an additional inspection, the director may charge a
re-inspection fee.
The record owner of a subsurface commercial basin must provide the Watershed Protection Department with a maintenance plan and an annual report
from a registered engineer verifying that the basin is in proper operating condition.
Until the City accepts a residential basin for maintenance, the record owner(s) of the residential basin and the residential development served shall
maintain the residential basin in accordance with the DCM standards.
The City shall be responsible for maintenance of a residential basin only after the residential basin has been accepted for maintenance by the City. The
City will accept a residential basin upon determining that it meets all requirements of the Drainage Criteria Manual.

§ 25-8-23 - CONDEMNATION AND ACCESSIBILITY EXCEPTIONS.
This subsection applies to property that has existing development or that is included in an approved site plan if the development on the property is
reconfigured as a result of right-of-way condemnation.
The accountable official may approve the replacement of development that existed in the condemned area of the property onto the remainder of the
property.
For development that may be replaced under Subsection (A)(1), the director of the Watershed Protection Department may vary the requirements of
this subchapter for development in the water quality transition zone and the critical water quality zone and the limitations of this subchapter on
impervious cover after making a determination that the replacement development will not increase the pollutant loading.
For property that had existing development or that was included in a released site plan on March 10, 1996, the accountable official may approve
additional development that exceeds the impervious cover limitations of this title if the director determines that the increased impervious cover is
necessary to comply with the accessibility standards of the Americans With Disabilities Act or the Uniform Building Code.

Division 3. - Variances.
§ 25-8-41 - LAND USE COMMISSION VARIANCES.
It is the applicant's burden to establish that the findings described in this Section have been met. Except as provided in Subsections (B) and (C), the Land
Use Commission may grant a variance from a requirement of this subchapter after determining that:
the requirement will deprive the applicant of a privilege available to owners of other similarly situated property with approximately contemporaneous
development subject to similar code requirements;
the variance:
is not necessitated by the scale, layout, construction method, or other design decision made by the applicant, unless the design decision provides
greater overall environmental protection than is achievable without the variance;
is the minimum deviation from the code requirement necessary to allow a reasonable use of the property; and
does not create a significant probability of harmful environmental consequences; and
development with the variance will result in water quality that is at least equal to the water quality achievable without the variance.
The Land Use Commission may grant a variance from a requirement of Section 25-8-422 (Water Quality Transition Zone), Section 25-8-452 (Water Quality
Transition Zone), Section 25-8-482 (Water Quality Transition Zone), Section 25-8-652 (Restrictions on Development Impacting Lake Austin, Lady Bird Lake,
and Lake Walter E. Long), or Article 7, Division 1 (Critical Water Quality Zone Restrictions), after determining that:
the criteria for granting a variance in Subsection (A) are met;
the requirement for which a variance is requested prevents a reasonable, economic use of the entire property; and
the variance is the minimum deviation from the code requirement necessary to allow a reasonable, economic use of the entire property.
The Land Use Commission may not grant a variance from a requirement of Article 13 (Save Our Springs Initiative).
The Land Use Commission shall prepare written findings of fact to support the grant or denial of a variance request under this section.

Division 2. - Protection for Special Features.
§ 25-8-281 - CRITICAL ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES.
Drainage patterns for proposed development must be designed to protect critical environmental features from the effects of runoff from developed
areas, and to maintain the catchment areas of recharge features in a natural state. Special controls must be used where necessary to avoid the effects of
erosion, or sedimentation, or high rates of flow.
A residential lot may not include a critical environmental feature or a critical environmental feature buffer zone and may not be located within 50 feet of a
critical environmental feature.
This subsection prescribes the requirements for critical environmental feature buffer zones.

For a point recharge feature, the buffer zone coincides with the topographically defined catchment basin, except that the width of the buffer zone
from the edge of the critical environmental feature is:
not less than 150 feet;
not more than 300 feet; and
calculated in accordance with the Environmental Criteria Manual.
Within a buffer zone described in this subsection:
the natural vegetative cover must be retained to the maximum extent practicable;
construction is prohibited; and
wastewater disposal or irrigation is prohibited.
If located at least 50 feet from the edge of the critical environmental feature, the prohibition of Subsection (C)(2)(b) does not apply to:
a hiking trail;
a recharge basin approved under Section 25-8-213 (Water Quality Control Standards) that discharges to a point recharge feature; or

standards of this section, enhance the recharge of groundwater and the discharge of springs, and maintain the function of critical environmental
features.
Perimeter fencing with not less than one access gate must be installed at the outer edge of the buffer zone for all point recharge features. The fencing
must comply with the Standard Specifications Manual.
The owner must maintain the buffer zone in accordance with standards in the Environmental Criteria Manual to preserve the water quality function of
the buffer.
All critical environmental feature locations and required setbacks must be shown on preliminary subdivision plans, site plans, and other permits as
determined by the director.
All critical environmental feature locations must be shown on final plats.
When voids in the rock substrate are uncovered during development, the following protocol must be followed:
construction in the area of the void must cease while the applicant conducts a preliminary investigation of the void as prescribed by the

§ 25-8-514 - POLLUTION PREVENTION REQUIRED.
In the watersheds contributing to Barton Springs, no development nor any revision, extension, or amendment thereof, may be approved unless it is
designed, carried out, and maintained on a site-by-site basis to meet the pollution prevention requirements set forth below for the life of the project. In
order to prevent pollution, impervious cover for all such development shall be limited to a maximum of 15 percent in the entire recharge zone, 20 percent
of the contributing zone within the Barton Creek watershed, and 25 percent in the remainder of the contributing zone. The impervious cover limits shall
be calculated on a net site area basis. In addition, runoff from such development shall be managed through water quality controls and onsite pollution
prevention and assimilation techniques so that no increases occur in the respective average annual loadings of total suspended solids, total phosphorus,
total nitrogen, chemical oxygen demand, total lead, cadmium, E. coli, volatile organic compounds, pesticides, and herbicides from the site. For a given
project, impervious cover shall be reduced if needed to assure compliance with these pollutant load restrictions.
Within the watersheds contributing to Barton Springs, Section 25-8-92 (Critical Water Quality Zones Established) of the Land Development Code is
amended so that in no event shall the boundary of the critical water quality zone be less than 200 feet from the centerline of a major waterway or be less
than 400 feet from the centerline of the main channel of Barton Creek. No pollution control structure, or residential or commercial building, may be
constructed in the critical water quality zone in these watersheds.

prevents a reasonable use of the property;
is an imminent hazard to life or property, and the hazard cannot reasonably be mitigated without removing the tree;
is dead;
is diseased, and:
restoration to sound condition is not practicable; or
the disease may be transmitted to other trees and endanger their health; or
for a tree located on public property or a public street or easement:
prevents the opening of necessary vehicular traffic lanes in a street or alley; or
prevents the construction of utility or drainage facilities that may not feasibly be rerouted.
If an application filed by a political subdivision of the state is approved under Subsection (A)(2), the Land Use Commission may, in its discretion, review
the approval.
For an application to remove a protected tree located on private property, an applicant must request a variance, waiver, exemption, modification, or

tree in determining whether to grant or deny the request for a variance, waiver, exemption, modification or alternative compliance from another City
Code provision.
This subsection does not require an applicant to request a variance, waiver, exemption, modification, or alternative compliance if the director
determines that to do so would endanger the public health and safety.
The Planning and Development Review Department shall require mitigation as a condition of application approval. A removal permit may not be issued
until the applicant satisfies the condition or posts fiscal security to ensure performance of the condition within one year.

Applicability; Intent.
This section applies to a site that is required to provide a compatibility buffer.
The intent of these requirements is to create a visual barrier between uses and to improve the urban environment for the future occupants of the
development and surrounding neighbors while balancing these objectives with the provision of housing.
In this section,
PROPERTY LINE means the property line that is shared with a triggering property; and
TRIGGERING PROPERTY means a property that:
includes at least one dwelling unit but less than four dwelling units; and
is zoned Urban Family Residence (SF-5) or more restrictive.
This subsection applies in all compatibility buffers.
Except as provided in this section, a compatibility buffer may not include vertical structures.
A compatibility buffer may include stormwater control measures and retaining walls.
A restricted zone within a compatibility buffer may include:
landscaping or gardens;
fences, walls, or berms;
surface parking lots, driveways, alleys, or fire lanes;
paths, walkways, or public use trails, including associated lighting;
utility infrastructure;
refuse receptacles;
bike racks, benches, and water fountains;
ground-floor private common and private personal open space; and
mechanical equipment.
A windowsill, belt course, cornice, flue, chimney, eave, box window, cantilevered bay window, or balcony may project two feet into the restricted zone.
A screening zone may include:
landscaping or gardens;
fences, walls, or berms;
paths, walkways, or public use trails, including associated lighting and gates;
utility infrastructure if a utility provider determines that it is necessary;
bike racks, benches, and water fountains; and
ground-floor private common and private personal open space.
In a compatibility buffer, vegetation must be:
listed in Appendix N of the Environmental Criteria Manual; and
irrigated, maintained, and certified in accordance with the Environmental Criteria Manual.
Nothing in this section requires an applicant to remove healthy and existing vegetation located within the screening zone.
If existing conditions or proposed utility infrastructure or easements prevent full compliance with the requirements of this section, the director may
approve an applicant's request for alternative methods of compliance that aligns with the intent of this section.
A compatibility buffer that is at least 25 feet in width must comply with this subsection.
The compatibility buffer shall include a screening zone and restricted zone.
Screening Zone.
The screening zone is parallel to the property line, begins at the property line, and extends ten feet into the property.
At 25 linear feet intervals parallel to the property line that is shared with a triggering property, the screening zone must include a minimum of:
1 large shade tree;
1 small understory tree; and
10 shrubs.
Restricted Zone. The restricted zone is parallel to the property line, begins at the edge of the screening zone, and extends an additional 15 feet into
the property.
A compatibility buffer that is more than 15 feet but less than 25 feet in width must comply with this subsection.

CHAPTER 25-10. - SIGN REGULATIONS.
ARTICLE 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS.
§ 25-10-1 - PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY.
This chapter establishes a comprehensive system for the regulation of signs within the City of Austin and its extraterritorial jurisdiction, to serve the
following purposes:
To protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the City and its residents and to implement the policies of the City's Comprehensive Plan.
To allow adequate opportunity for free speech in the form of messages or images displayed on signs, while balancing that interest against public
safety and aesthetic concerns impacted by signs.
To ensure that the design, location, construction, illumination, installation, repair, and maintenance of signs:
Does not interfere with traffic safety or otherwise endanger public safety;
Enhances and protects the aesthetic value of the City by reducing visual clutter that is potentially harmful to property values, economic
development, and quality of life; and
Is consistent with the character of districts in which the signs are located, including areas specially designated for historic, scenic or architectural
value.
To protect the safety and efficiency of the City's transportation system by reducing confusion and distractions to pedestrians and motorists, while
enhancing motorists' ability to see pedestrians, obstacles, other vehicles, and traffic signs.
Recognizing the unique impact of off-premise advertising on public safety, visual aesthetics, and quality of life, to restrict new off-premise signs and
minimize the impact of existing off-premise signs.
To prevent the inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over non-commercial speech, or favoring of any particular non-commercial speech over
any other non-commercial speech based on its content.

§ 25-10-43 - ACTION ON VARIANCE.
The Board of Adjustment may grant a variance from a requirement of this chapter after determining that granting the variance does not provide the
applicant with a special privilege not enjoyed by others similarly situated or potentially similarly situated; and
the variance is necessary because enforcement of the requirement prevents any reasonable opportunity to provide adequate signs on the site,

In this section, "asbestos survey" means an inspection, by an individual licensed by the state to perform the inspection, of a building or facility to
determine the location, quantity, and condition of asbestos containing material in the building by taking samples for analysis and by visual inspection.
The building official may not issue a permit to a person for the demolition or renovation of a building unless an asbestos survey has been conducted of
the areas of the building affected by the proposed renovation or demolition. A person seeking a permit must provide evidence of the survey to the
building official.
This section does not apply to:
a building owned by the state or federal government;
an industrial facility to which access is limited principally to employees of the facility because of processes or functions that are hazardous to human
safety or health;
a manufacturing facility or building that is limited to workers and invited guests under controlled conditions;
a building, or any portion of a building that a professional engineer, a registered architect, or a city, county, or state government official determines to
be structurally unsound and in danger of imminent collapse; or
a single family dwelling, or a residential use with four or fewer units.
A person who obtains a survey of a building in its entirety is not required to obtain additional surveys for subsequent renovations or demolitions of the
building.
Instead of a criminal prosecution under this section, the building official may impose a civil penalty not to exceed $2,000 for each instance of a violation of
this section. The building official may impose a separate penalty for each day that a violation continues. The city attorney may initiate a civil action to
recover a penalty owed under this section.
A person commits an offense if the person begins, conducts, or continues demolition or renovation operations without an asbestos survey required by
this section. A culpable mental state is not required, and need not be proved, for an offense under this section. Each instance of a violation under this
section is a separate offense. Each day that a violation continues is a separate offense. An offense is punishable by a fine not to exceed $2,000.

A building, structure, or site is subject to this article if a designation as a historic landmark is pending. A permit issued for abuilding, structure, or site
while a designation as a historic landmark is pending is void.
A designation is pending under Subsection (A) on the occurrence of the earliest of the following:
two members of the Commission direct the historic preservation officer in writing to place the building, structure, or site on the Commission's agenda
for consideration of whether the building, structure, or site should be designated as a historic landmark; or
Commission agenda is posted that includes Commission consideration of whether the building, structure, or site should be designated as a historic
landmark.
a Commission agenda is posted that includes Commission consideration of an application for a demolition, relocation, or building permit concerning
the building, structure, or site.
A written order issued by a member of the Commission under Section (B)(1) must address:
whether the structure should be considered for historic zoning;
whether the status quo of the structure should be maintained pending historic zoning proceedings; and
whether, if the status quo is not maintained pending historic zoning proceedings, the zoning of the structure as historic may become moot.
A designation is no longer pending if:
the Commission issues a final certificate of appropriateness, or a demolition, relocation, or building permit, as applicable;
the Commission does not make a final decision on whether to recommend designation of the structure as a historic landmark by the 75th day after
the date of the first Commission meeting at which an item is posted on the agenda for action on an application for demolition, relocation, or historic
zoning;
the Commission makes a final decision to recommend that the structure not be designated a historic landmark; or
the council makes a final decision not to designate the structure as a historic landmark.
The historic preservation officer shall provide the building official with a copy of each written order, agenda, or preservation plan described in Subsection
(B), as promptly as practicable. The failure to do so does not validate a building permit, relocation permit, or demolition permit issued without notice of
the written order or agenda.
If a permit from the City is not required for the change to the structure, the historic preservation officer must provide notice to the owner of the structure
of a written order, or agenda that applies to the change.
Notice under this subsection may be oral or written.
Notice under this subsection is effective:

Restrictions. The City Council shall not issue a variance for any proposed development in a floodway if any increase in flood levels would result during
the design flood discharge.
Considerations. In reviewing applications for variances, the City Council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all other portions
of this section, and each of the following:
The danger that materials and debris may be swept onto other lands resulting in further injury or damage.
The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
The susceptibility of the proposed development, including contents, to flood damage and the effect of such damage on current and future
owners.
The importance of the services provided by the proposed development to the community.
The availability of alternate locations for the proposed development that are not subject to flooding or erosion.
The compatibility of the proposed development with existing and anticipated development.
The relationship of the proposed development to the comprehensive plan and flood plain management program for that area.
The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles.
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and debris and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and bridges.
Conditions for issuance. Variances shall only be issued by the City Council upon:
a technical showing of good and sufficient cause based on the unique characteristics of the size, configuration or topography of the site;
a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship by rendering the lot undevelopable;
a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public
expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances;
a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and
notification to the applicant in writing over the signature of the building official that the issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance, and that such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property.

this section, a written statement means a stamp that reads "REVIEWED FOR CODE COMPLIANCE" and is placed on the plans and specifications.
After the permit is issued, a person may not change, modify, or alter plans and specifications without the approval of the building official.
Work regulated by the Electrical Code shall be done consistent with reviewed plans and specifications.
If a building, structure, or tenant finish out will exceed 5,000 square feet, a Professional Engineer licensed by the State of Texas must seal the
required drawing.
If a building, structure, or tenant finish out is 5,000 square feet or less, a master electrician licensed by the Texas Department of Licensing and
Regulation must sign the required drawing and include the master electrician's license number or a Professional Engineer licensed by the State of
Texas may seal the required drawing.
The building official may issue a permit for the construction of part of an electrical system before the plans and specifications for the entire
system have been submitted or approved if the applicant provides adequate information and detailed statements that comply with the
requirements of the Electrical Code. The electrical permit holder may proceed at the permit holder's own risk, without assurance that the permit
for the entire building, structure, or building service will be approved. The issuance of a permit for part of an electrical system does not obligate
the building official to approve the remaining electrical permits.
Permit required. Except as specified in Section 80.19(C)(3), a person who intends to install, alter, repair, replace, or remodel an electrical system must
apply for and obtain a permit before the activity commences.

Aggrading juniper shrub fuel type is dominated by live oak-juniper and juniper savanna. It is present throughout the county. It includes both Ashe
juniper (Juniperus ashei), predominantly in western Travis County, and eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana), predominately in eastern Travis
County. Juniper scorch and mortality values by size class are nearly identical between these two Juniperus species (Engle and Stritzke 1995).
Closed juniper woodland has sufficient canopy closure to limit growth of tall grass (18 inches or more tall) to less than 50 percent of the ground cover.
Juniper, including Ashe juniper and/or eastern redcedar, and deciduous trees are the dominant vegetation types.
Mixed juniper hardwood forest fuel type is 25-percent juniper, 75-percent deciduous class.

101.1 Title. These regulations are known as the City of Austin Property Maintenance Code and are referred to as the "Property Maintenance Code" or "this
code."
102.3 Application of other codes. Repairs, additions or alterations to a structure, or changes of occupancy, must be done in accordance with the
procedures and provisions of Title 25(Land Development Code).
103.1 General. The City Manager must designate the department or departments charged with enforcement of this code.
103.2 Designation. The City Manager must designate a code official.
103.3 Inspectors. The code official may designate inspectors to assist with enforcement of this code. Such employees must have powers and duties
delegated by the code official.
104.1 Costs. The City may assess a property owner for costs incurred to demolish, board, fence, secure, vacate, relocate occupants, repair, treat, remediate
or similar action identified in this code. This includes the costs incurred because a property owner fails to comply with a Commission order. Unless
exempted by the Texas Constitution, the expense incurred by the City under this code may be recorded as a lien against the real property on which the
building, structure, or noncompliant condition is located, with interest on the unpaid balance to accrue at the maximum rate allowed by law.
104.2 Funds. Unless otherwise provided for or directed by a Commission order, a cost incurred by the city or its agent to repair, remediate, vacate, relocate
occupants from, secure, or clean a structure, building, or property because an owner fails to comply with a Commission order must be paid from
demolition funds budgeted by the city council.
105.2 Inspections. The code official is authorized to make inspections and may consider written inspection reports prepared and certified by approved
agencies or individuals. The code official is authorized to engage such expert opinion as deemed necessary to report upon unusual technical issues that
arise.
105.3 Right of Entry. Whenever it is necessary to make an inspection to enforce the provisions of this code, or whenever the code official has reasonable or
probable cause to believe that a violation exists in a structure or upon a premises, the code official is authorized to enter the structure or premises at
reasonable times to inspect or perform the duties authorized by this code or City Code. An owner or other authorized individual may refuse to consent to
an inspection conducted by the code official. If consent is refused, the code official may seek an administrative search warrant authorized by Article 18 of
the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure (Search Warrants) and City Code Section 2-10-1 (Jurisdiction and Authority). Nothing in this code limits the ability of
the code official to inspect as necessary or as authorized by other law.
105.8 Commencement of Proceedings. Whenever the code official finds that a structure or premise is substandard or dangerous, the code official is
authorized to begin proceedings to cause the repair, rehabilitation, vacation, demolition, removal, boarding or fencing or other means of closure of the
building, structure, or premise.

facts supporting the appeal, describing the relief sought, and presenting the reasons why the appealed notice or action should be reversed, modified or
otherwise set aside. A request for additional time to comply with the notice due to financial inability or other extenuating circumstance is not a proper
basis for appeal.
106.4 Effect of an appeal. Unless otherwise provided in this code or, in the opinion of the code official, a delay would present an immediate danger or
unreasonable risk to any person or property, filing an appeal stays further City action under the notice being appealed.
107.1 Unlawful acts. A person that fails to comply with this code, a notice of violation issued under this code, or an order issued under this code commits
an offense.
107.3 Prosecution of a violation. A violation of this code is a misdemeanor punishable as set forth in City Code Section 25-1-462(Criminal Enforcement).
The filing of a criminal action does not preclude the pursuit of a civil, quasi-judicial, or administrative action for violation of this code.

902.1 Criminal Offense and Penalty. A person commits an offense if the person fails to comply with a final order issued by the Commission. Each day that
a person fails to comply with a final order is a separate occurrence. An offense under this section is a class C misdemeanor. The maximum penalty must be
$500 per offense, per occurrence. Proof of a culpable mental state is not required for conviction of an offense under this section.
SECTION 903 PERFORMANCE OF WORK REQUIRED FOR COMPLIANCE WITH A COMMISSION ORDER.
903.1 Demolition and Remediation authorized. In addition to any other remedy provided in this section, and on the failure of the owner to comply with
any predicate or requirement of a Commission order, the code official may perform, procure, or contract for any work, services, materials,
accommodations, or action required of the property owner by the Commission order. This includes engineering surveys or inspections, cost estimates,
construction scheduling, asbestos testing, design services, plan preparation, permitting, fencing, stabilization, grading, filing, draining, the closure of a
building, the vacation and relocation of occupants, the removal of personalty or disposal of debris, and the treatment or cleaning of the premises and the
lot.
903.2 Personalty on the Premises. A property owner is responsible for removing personalty from a structure that must be vacated or demolished. If the
City or its agent demolishes the structure, the personalty remaining on the property is considered abandoned and may be removed by the City or its agent
in the same manner as other rubbish or debris.
CHAPTER 10 LANDLORD/TENANT RELATIONSHIPS.
1001 Responsibility of Landlord. The owner of a building, structure, or property remains responsible for compliance with this Code notwithstanding any
rental or other agreement purporting to give tenants or other third parties certain duties or responsibilities with respect to the building, structure, or
property.
1002 Retaliation.
1002.1 Prohibited. A property owner, owner's agent, management company, or other person responsible for managing a property commits an offense if
the property owner, owner's agent, management company, or other person responsible for managing a property raises a tenant's rent, diminishes services
to the tenant, or attempts eviction for reasons other than nonpayment of rent or other good cause for six months after a complaint is filed by the tenant
with the code official complaining of violations of this code or for six months after completion of repairs required by a notice or order issued under this
code, whichever time period is longer.
1002.2 Penalty. Unless a culpable mental state is established, a violation of Section 1002 (Retaliation) is an offense, punishable by a fine not to exceed $500
per occurrence. If proof of a culpable mental state is established, a violation of Section 1002 (Retaliation) is punishable by a fine not to exceed $2,000 per
occurrence.
1002.3 Affirmative Defense. It is an affirmative defense to prosecution under Section 1002 (Retaliation) if the action was:
an increase in rent under an escalation clause for utilities, taxes, or insurance in a written rental agreement;
an increase in rent or reduction in services against the complaining tenant which are a part of a pattern of rental increases or service reductions
uniformly applied for an entire multifamily dwelling project of four or more units; or
an increase in rent that is reasonably related to repairs or improvements actually made by the landlord after a complaint has been filed and which do
not cause the total rent to exceed fair market value of the premises. However, no rental increase may be made until the structure is in full compliance
with any notice or order issued under this code.
CHAPTER 11 INTERFERENCE WITH REPAIR OR DEMOLITION WORK PROHIBITED.
1101 GENERAL. No person must obstruct, impede, or interfere with work performed by any of the following individuals for purposes of boarding, securing,

presentation of the proper credentials. An owner or other authorized individual may refuse to consent to an inspection conducted by the code official. If
consent is refused, that refusal is grounds for suspension of any current license, or denial of any license renewal associated with or assigned to that
boarding house, hotel, or bed and breakfast establishment. The code official may seek an administrative search warrant authorized by Article 18 of the
Texas Code of Criminal Procedure (Search Warrant) and City Code Section 2-10-1 (Jurisdiction and Authority). Nothing in this code limits the ability of the
code official to inspect as necessary or as authorized by other law.
1302 Licenses and permits required. No person may operate a boarding house, hotel, or bed and breakfast establishment unless a license for the
operation, in the name of the owner or operator and for the specific dwelling unit, partial unit, accessory unit, building, structure, or property used, has
been issued by the code official and is currently valid and in good standing. Unless specifically exempted by the provisions of Chapter 10-3 (Food and Food
Handlers), each regulated lodging establishment that provides meals or food service is required to have a permit as a food service establishment issued by
the Health Authority.
1303 Leasing, renting, or advertising units or rooms in an unlicensed hotel, boarding house, or bed and breakfast establishment is an offense.
An owner, manager, operator, or person in control of a hotel, boarding house, or bed and breakfast establishment commits an offense if the owner or
other person leases, rents, advertises, promotes, or otherwise solicits or induces occupancy of a room, structure, dwelling unit, or partial unit in a hotel,
boarding house, or bed and breakfast establishment which does not have a valid license issued and displayed as required by this chapter or as required
by Title 25(Land Development).
A person may not advertise or promote a licensed establishment without including the license number assigned to the establishment by the city in the
advertisement or promotion.
Each day that an owner, manager, operator, or other person in control of the property leases, rents, advertises, promotes, or otherwise solicits or induces
occupancy of a room in a hotel, boarding house, or bed and breakfast establishment which does not have a valid license issued, disclosed, and displayed
as required by this chapter is a separate occurrence. An offense under this section is a class C misdemeanor, punishable by a fine not to exceed $500 per
offense, per occurrence, unless proof of a culpable mental state is proven. If proof of a culpable mental state is demonstrated, an offense under this
section is punishable by a fine not to exceed $2,000 per occurrence.
It is an affirmative defense to a violation of Section 1303 if the advertisement or promotion conspicuously disclosed that reservation, occupancy, or rental
of the facility is contingent on a pending city licensure application.
1304 Application. An application for a license required by this chapter must be in writing and submitted to the code official. To be considered complete,
the application must include all information and documentation required by the Land Development Code regulations specific to the use type or indicated
as required by the code official and this code.
1305 Fee. Each application for a hotel, motel, boarding house, or bed and breakfast establishment license must be accompanied by the payment of a fee in
an amount established by separate ordinance. A regulated lodging establishment fee must be prorated on a quarterly basis.
1306 Issuance. A boarding house, hotel, or bed and breakfast establishment license must be issued by the code official after the code official determines
that the owner or operator has complied with all applicable ordinances and rules. A license must not be issued or renewed by the code official for any
applicant or location in the absence of proof of the applicant or location's substantial compliance with all applicable local hotel occupancy tax rules and
regulations.
1307 License suspension.
Except as provided in subsection (D), whenever the code official finds on inspection of the physical premises or review of applicable records of any
boarding house, hotel, or bed and breakfast establishment that conditions or practices exist that violate any provision of the Property Maintenance Code,
City Code, or any rule or regulation adopted under this code, or that the establishment has failed to comply with any provision, prohibition, or
requirement related to the registration, reporting, collection, segregation, accounting, disclosure, or payment of local hotel occupancy taxes, the code
official must give written notice to the owner of the property and the operator of the boarding house, hotel, or bed and breakfast establishment that
unless the violations are corrected by an identified deadline, the license must be suspended.
At the end of the time provided for correction of the violation(s), the code official must re-inspect the location or records of the boarding house, hotel, or
bed and breakfast establishment and, if the conditions or practices have not been corrected, must suspend the license and give written notice to the
licensee that the license has been suspended.
On receipt of notice of suspension, the licensee must immediately stop operation of the boarding house, hotel, or bed and breakfast establishment, and
no person may occupy for sleeping or living purposes any rooming unit therein. The notice required by this subsection must be served in accordance with
the notice provisions of applicable law.
The code official may immediately suspend a license if the code official determines that the license was issued in error. A suspension is effective until the
code official determines that the licensee has complied with the requirements of the City Code or any rule or regulation adopted under this code. The
code official must give written notice to the owner of the property and the operator of the establishment that the license is suspended.

An appeal filed under this section must be filed with the code official no later than the 20th day following the date on which the license was denied or
suspended, or notice of violation was received. The appeal must identify each alleged point of error, facts and evidence supporting the appeal, reasons
why the action of the code official should be set aside, modified, or reversed, and must be sworn. The appeal must be set for hearing before the
Commission on the next available agenda date following receipt of the appeal and must be heard following setting on the scheduled agenda if a quorum
is present at the hearing, unless the appellant requests a later date and waives the scheduled hearing.
An appeal of under this section does not stay enforcement of license requirements.
1309 Expiration.

unless prior to the end of the calendar year, the license is voided, suspended, or revoked as provided in this chapter, as provided in another section of City
Code, or by court order, or other operation of law.
1310 Transfer and notice on sale of premises. A license issued under this chapter is not transferable. Every person holding a license must give written
notice to the code official no later than 10 days before the conveyance, transfer, or any other disposition of the ownership of, interest in, or control of any

HEIGHT, BUILDING has the same meaning as "height" as defined in City Code Section 25-1-21(Definitions).
START OF CONSTRUCTION means the date a permit is issued for new construction or substantial improvements to existing structures if construction,
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement starts within 180 days from the date the permit is issued. Construction
starts when permanent construction of a building (including a manufactured home) is first placed and includes pouring a slab or footing, installing pilings,

or constructing columns. Permanent construction does not include preparing land (clearing, excavating, grading, or filing); installing streets or walkways;
excavating for a basement, footing, pier, or foundation, erecting temporary forms or installing accessory buildings not occupied as dwelling units or not
part of the main building. For a substantial improvement, construction starts when a wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building is altered even
if the alteration does not affect the external dimensions of the building.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE means an amount of damage that results in restoration costs that equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT means any combination of repairs, alterations, reconstructions, rehabilitations, additions, or improvements to a building or
structure during the immediate 10-year period with cumulative costs that equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the
improvement or repair is started or, if the structure was damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. If the structure has sustained
substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed. Substantial improvement does
not include:
an improvement required to correct existing health, sanitary, safety code violations identified by the building official and that are the minimum
necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
an alteration to a historic structure if the alteration will not disqualify the structure from continuing its designation as a historic structure, which
means a structure that is listed or preliminarily determined eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, determined by the Secretary
of the United States Department of Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district, or a district preliminarily
determined to qualify as a historic district, or designated as historic under a State of Texas or local historic preservation program that is approved by
the United States Department of the Interior.
SURCHARGE means the vertical load imposed on retained soil that may impose a lateral force in addition to the lateral earth pressure of retained soil.
VISITABLE DWELLING means a dwelling subject to Visitability requirements in section R322 (Accessibility and Visitability).

R403.3.13 Batch Testing. For buildings having eight or more dwelling units or sleeping units, seven or 20 percent of the dwelling units or sleeping units,
whichever is greater shall be tested as required by Sections R402.5.1.2, R403.3.7, R403.3.8, R403.3.10, R403.3.11, R403.3.12, and R403.6.3. If each tested
dwelling unit or sleeping unit within the batch meets code requirements, then all dwelling units or sleeping units in the batch are considered to meet code.
The third-party testing contractor shall perform all required tests on at least three consecutive dwelling units or sleeping units. Test results must meet code
requirements before batch testing is allowed. Initial testing is required for each new multifamily project. Dwelling units or sleeping units must be within the
same building to qualify for inclusion in a batch.
Batch Identification and Sampling
The builder shall identify a "batch" which is a building where the dwelling units or sleeping units are completed and ready for testing. The third-party
testing contractor randomly selects the dwelling units and/or sleeping units from a batch for testing. A batch shall include a top floor dwelling unit, a
ground floor dwelling unit, a middle floor dwelling unit, and the dwelling unit with the largest conditioned floor area. Where buildings have fewer than eight
dwelling units or sleeping units, each dwelling unit or sleeping units shall be tested. All dwelling units or sleeping units within the batch must be ready for
testing (drywall complete, interior door jams installed, HVAC system installed, and final air sealing completed) before the third-party testing contractor can
select the units to be tested.
Failure to Meet Code Requirement(s)
If any dwelling units or sleeping units within the identified batch fail to meet a code requirement as a result of testing, the builder will be directed to fix
the cause(s) of failure, and 30% of the remaining dwelling units or sleeping units in the batch will be randomly selected for testing regarding the specific
cause(s) of failure.
If any failures occur in the additional dwelling units or sleeping units, all remaining dwelling units or sleeping units in the batch must be individually tested
for code compliance.
A multifamily project with 3 failures within a 6-month period is no longer eligible to use the sampling protocol in that community or project until
successfully repeating "Initial Testing." Sampling can be reinstated after at least 3 consecutive dwelling units or sleeping units are individually verified to
meet all code requirements.
No dwelling unit or sleeping unit in a batch may be issued a Certificate of Occupancy until testing has been performed and passed on the dwelling units
or sleeping units selected for testing.
