§ 25-6-263 - CONSTRUCTION PERMIT FOR DRIVEWAY APPROACH.
(A) Except as provided in Subsection (C), the city manager shall approve a construction permit application for a driveway approach unless the city manager
determines that the proposed driveway will have an adverse effect on vehicle and pedestrian traffic and public safety.
(B) To determine the effect of a proposed driveway, the city manager shall consider:
(1) the topography of the land;
(2) land use, including the intensity of development, potential trip generation, the mix of vehicles, and turning movement;
(3) function of the public street, including the design and layout of the street, sight distance, operating speed, traffic volume, entrance/exit ramps, and
frontage roads;
(4) the location of a nearby street or driveway;
(5) the site plan, including on-site circulation, path delineation, the existence of parking stalls, building location, and loading facility location; and,
(6) the potential increase in traffic routed onto a local residential street as a result of the driveway installation.
(C) The city manager may not issue a permit for a driveway approach for:
(1) a driveway that provides access to or cut a curb that fronts on Lamar Boulevard between West 24th Street and West 30th Street; and,
(2) a project that provides for parking between an established curb line or edge of paving and the property line of the adjacent property, unless
specifically directed by the council.
(D) A person may not construct a type 2 driveway approach to provide access to angle or head-in parking for which a portion of the pedestrian way is
required to maneuver in or out of a space unless the person obtains a permit that states that the city manager has approved the construction.
(E) An applicant may appeal a decision of the city manager under this section to the Land Use Commission. In making a determination on an appeal filed
under this section, the Land Use Commission shall consider the factors in Subsection (B).
