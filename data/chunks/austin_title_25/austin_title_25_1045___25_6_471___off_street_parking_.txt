development (PUD) that includes specific off-site parking requirements controls over this article.
(B) A minimum of one on-site accessible space is required. The minimum number of accessible spaces is calculated by taking 100 percent of the parking
previously required for the use under Appendix A (Tables of Off-Street Loading Requirements and Former Off-Street Parking Requirements) and using
that result to determine the number of accessible parking spaces required under the Building Code.
(C) If an applicant provides an off-street parking facility for a building or use, accessible spaces must be provided on-site.
(D) If an applicant provides only accessible spaces for a use:
(1) Accessible spaces may be located on- or off-site, within 250 feet of the use, and must be on an accessible route.
(2) An off-site or on-street accessible space that is located within 250 feet of a use may be counted towards the number of required accessible spaces
under Subsection (B).
(3) The director may waive or reduce the number of accessible space required if no accessible spaces can be provided consistent with the requirements
of Paragraph (D)(1).
(E) The accessible space parking requirement for a site with more than one use or for adjacent sites served by a common parking facility is the cumulative
total of spaces required for each site or use.
(F) In this section:
QUALIFYING DEVELOPMENT means a development certified under Section 25-1-724 (Certification) and participating in the Affordability Unlocked
Bonus Program.
(G) A qualifying development is not required to comply with Appendix A of Chapter 25-6 (Transportation) but must comply with this section.
(1) The minimum number of required off-street accessible spaces is the greater of:
(a) one accessible parking space;
(b) the number of accessible spaces required under the Building Code based on 100 percent of the parking previously required for the use under
Appendix A (Tables of Off-Street Loading Requirements and Former Off-Street Parking Requirements); or
(c) the number of accessible spaces required under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or the Fair Housing Act Amendments (FHAA), as
appropriate.
(2) An accessible space must be adjacent to the site and on an accessible route.
(3) An accessible parking space must comply with design, accessibility, and location requirements imposed by the ADA and the FFHA, as appropriate.
(4) Accessible parking detailed in Subsection (G)(1) must be provided off-street except insofar as on-street or off-site parking is allowed elsewhere in this
title.
