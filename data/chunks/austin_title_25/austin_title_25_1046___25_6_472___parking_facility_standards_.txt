§ 25-6-472 - PARKING FACILITY STANDARDS.
(A) Except as provided in Section 25-6-473 (Modification of Parking Requirement), a parking facility for a use must comply with the requirements in Section
25-6-471 (Off-Street Parking) and Appendix A (Tables of Off-Street Loading Requirements and Former Off-Street Parking Requirements), as applicable.
(B) A parking facility must:
(1) be maintained for the duration of the use or existence of the building requiring the facility; and
(2) be used exclusively for the temporary parking of passenger automobiles, motor vehicles, or light trucks not exceeding one ton in capacity.
(C) A parking facility requirement is based on gross floor area of a building or use served by the facility. For the purpose of calculating parking requirements,
gross floor area does not include enclosed or covered areas used for off-street parking or loading, bicycle storage rooms or shower facilities.
(D) The parking facility requirement for a general retail service use in a shopping center is based on the gross floor area of the entire shopping center,
including portions not used for a general retail use. The parking requirement for a use in a shopping center other than a general retail service use is
based on the rate for the use.
(E) Except in the central business district (CBD) or a downtown mixed use (DMU) zoning district, an outdoor seating area for a restaurant (general) or a
cocktail lounge use must be included with the gross floor area to determine the parking requirement.
(F) If a calculation under Appendix A (Tables of Off-Street Loading Requirements and Former Off-Street Parking Requirements) results in a fractional
requirement, a fraction of 0.5 or greater is rounded to the next larger whole number.
(G) If a parking facility requirement is based on seating or capacity, occupancy is determined as prescribed in Chapter 25-12 (Uniform Building Code).
(H) Head-in parking is prohibited in a townhouse and condominium residential (SF-6) or less restrictive zoning district.
