spaces previously required for the use under Appendix A (Tables of Off-Street Loading Requirements and Former Off-Street Parking Requirements).
(B) A minimum of one on-site accessible space is required on an accessible route. If no driveway is provided, a minimum of one on-street or off-site
accessible space is required on an accessible route per Subsection 25-6-471(D)(2). Sites that do not have dedicated motor vehicle parking spaces and no
driveway access to, from, or through the site are exempt from providing on-site accessible spaces.

also seek a waiver pursuant to Subsection (G) of Section 25-6-477 (Bicycle Parking) to waive bicycle parking.
