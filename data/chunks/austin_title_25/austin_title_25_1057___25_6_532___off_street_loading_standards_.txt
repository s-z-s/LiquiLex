§ 25-6-532 - OFF-STREET LOADING STANDARDS.
(A) A person must provide an off-street loading facility for each use in a building or on a site as prescribed in Appendix A (Tables of Off-Street Loading
Requirements and Former Off-Street Parking Requirements).
(B) Multiple uses or occupancies located in a single building or on one site may be served by a common loading space if the director determines that the
loading space can adequately serve each use.
(C) For a common loading space, described under Subsection (B), the director shall apply Appendix A (Tables of Off-Street Loading Requirements and Former
Off-Street Parking Requirements) to the combination of buildings and uses served by the loading space instead of to each individual building and use. The
schedule applicable to the use with the greatest load requirement shall be used.
(D) An off-street loading facility requirement is based on the gross floor area. The gross floor area does not include enclosed or covered areas used for off-
street parking or loading.
(E) In this section, each two square feet of exterior site area used for a commercial or industrial use equals one square foot enclosed floor area.
