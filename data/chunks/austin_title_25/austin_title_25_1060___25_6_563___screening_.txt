The wall, fence or landscape must be at least six feet in height and must be located on the common boundary between the parking facility and the
adjoining property for the length of the common boundary.
(C) A screen prescribed under Subsection (A) or (B) must be located on the property line unless:

(2) placement of the screen on the property line would interfere with an existing drainage feature or utility.
(D) If a person places screening on the property other than on the property line, the person must provide lot line monuments along the property line.
(E) The director may waive a screening requirement prescribed by Subsection (A) or (B) if:
(1) the director determines that extraordinary conditions exist as defined in the Environmental Criteria Manual; or
(2) the property owner who benefits from the screening submits a written statement to the director that the owner would prefer that screening not be
provided.
(F) The director or the Land Use Commission may modify a design and construction requirement of this division for a site subject to site plan review if the
