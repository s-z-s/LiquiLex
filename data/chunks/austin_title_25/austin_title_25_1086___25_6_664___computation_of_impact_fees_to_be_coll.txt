§ 25-6-664 - COMPUTATION OF IMPACT FEES TO BE COLLECTED.
(A) The City shall compute the amount of street impact fees to be paid and collected for new development in the following manner:
(1) Determine the number of development units for each land use category using the LUVMET then in effect.
(2) Multiply the number of development units for each land use category in the new development by the service unit for each corresponding land use
category in the LUVMET to determine the number of service units attributable to the new development.
(3) Multiply the number of service units for the new development by the street impact fee per service unit to be collected for the applicable service area
and applicable land use.
(B) If an agreement as described in City Code Section 25-6-669 (Offsets Against Street Impact Fees) providing for offsets exists, the amount of the offsets shall
be deducted from the street impact fees as calculated above.
(C) If the applicant proposes to increase the number of service units for a development that has already paid a street impact fee, the additional street impact
fees collected for such new service units shall be determined by using the LUVMET.
(D) Any additional street impact fees shall be measured by the increase in the number of service units proposed from the number of service units from the
preceding land use within the last five years.

(E) If a building permit application is for a speculative building, the amount of the street impact fee shall be calculated assuming that the entire building will
be used as either "General Office", "Light Industrial", or "Shopping Center" as shown in the LUVMET. When a subsequent application for a building permit
is submitted, an additional street impact fee shall be calculated if the proposed use results in an increase of service units.
