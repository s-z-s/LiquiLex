§ 25-1-441 - STOP WORK ORDER.
(A) If the director determines that a person required to obtain a site plan, subdivision construction plan, or permit has not complied with a requirement of
this title, the director may order the person to stop the development of or transportation of construction material to the site until the person complies
with the requirements of this title.

(1) a City inspection may not be performed, and work requiring an inspection may not be approved; and
(2) a person may not connect a utility at the site.
(C) If a stop work order is based on a failed inspection, a person may not further develop the site until the development passes a reinspection.

complies with the requirements of this title.

(1) must state that no work may be performed at the site if traffic is obstructed, unless the person obtains a right-of-way use permit;
(2) must state that noncompliance may result in the immediate removal of an obstruction from the right-of-way and the arrest of an equipment
operator; and
