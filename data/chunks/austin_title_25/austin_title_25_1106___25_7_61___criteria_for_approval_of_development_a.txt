§ 25-7-61 - CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL OF DEVELOPMENT APPLICATIONS.
(A) A development application may not be approved unless:
(1) the proposed development application demonstrates sufficient capacity for the design flood, as determined under the Drainage Criteria Manual;
(2) each proposed improvement is sufficiently strong to resist:
(a) external pressure caused by earth or building; and
(b) internal pressure or abrasion caused by water or debris;
(3) the proposed grades will not permit water to gather in a pool that may become stagnant, excluding variable pools in creek beds as a result of natural
channel design;
(4) temporary and permanent measures to control erosion are sufficient to minimize siltation of the waterway, as determined under the Environmental
Criteria Manual; and
(5) the proposed development:
(a) will not result in additional adverse flooding impact on other property;
(b) to the greatest extent feasible, preserves the natural and traditional character of the land and the waterway located within the 100-year
floodplain;
(c) except as provided by Subsection (B), includes on-site control of the two-year peak flow, as determined under the Drainage Criteria Manual and
the Environmental Criteria Manual;
(d) will not result in additional erosion impacts on other property; and
(e) locates all proposed improvements outside the erosion hazard zone, unless protective works are provided as prescribed in the Drainage Criteria
Manual.
(B) A proposed development may provide off-site control of the two-year peak flow, if the off-site control will not cause:
(1) an adverse water quality impact from increased in-stream peak flow; or
(2) streambank erosion.
