§ 25-8-23 - CONDEMNATION AND ACCESSIBILITY EXCEPTIONS.
(A) This subsection applies to property that has existing development or that is included in an approved site plan if the development on the property is
reconfigured as a result of right-of-way condemnation.
(1) The accountable official may approve the replacement of development that existed in the condemned area of the property onto the remainder of the
property.
(2) For development that may be replaced under Subsection (A)(1), the director of the Watershed Protection Department may vary the requirements of
this subchapter for development in the water quality transition zone and the critical water quality zone and the limitations of this subchapter on
impervious cover after making a determination that the replacement development will not increase the pollutant loading.
(B) For property that had existing development or that was included in a released site plan on March 10, 1996, the accountable official may approve
additional development that exceeds the impervious cover limitations of this title if the director determines that the increased impervious cover is
necessary to comply with the accessibility standards of the Americans With Disabilities Act or the Uniform Building Code.
