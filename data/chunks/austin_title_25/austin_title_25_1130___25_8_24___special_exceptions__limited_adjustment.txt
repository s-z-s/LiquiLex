§ 25-8-24 - SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS; LIMITED ADJUSTMENT.
(A) Except as prohibited by Article 13 (Save Our Springs Initiative), a special exception from the requirements of this subchapter may be granted in
accordance with Chapter 25-1 (General Requirements and Procedures).
(B) If a three-quarters majority of the City Council concludes, or a court of competent jurisdiction renders a final judgment concluding that identified sections
of this subchapter, as applied to a specific development project or proposal violate the United States Constitution or the Texas Constitution or are
inconsistent with federal or state statutes that may preempt a municipal ordinance or the Austin City Charter, the City Council may, after a public hearing,
adjust the application of this subchapter to that project to the minimum extent required to comply with the conflicting law. Any adjustment shall be
structured to provide the maximum protection of water quality.
