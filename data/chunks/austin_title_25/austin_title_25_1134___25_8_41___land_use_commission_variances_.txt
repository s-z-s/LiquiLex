§ 25-8-41 - LAND USE COMMISSION VARIANCES.
(A) It is the applicant's burden to establish that the findings described in this Section have been met. Except as provided in Subsections (B) and (C), the Land
Use Commission may grant a variance from a requirement of this subchapter after determining that:
(1) the requirement will deprive the applicant of a privilege available to owners of other similarly situated property with approximately contemporaneous
development subject to similar code requirements;
(2) the variance:
(a) is not necessitated by the scale, layout, construction method, or other design decision made by the applicant, unless the design decision provides
greater overall environmental protection than is achievable without the variance;
(b) is the minimum deviation from the code requirement necessary to allow a reasonable use of the property; and
(c) does not create a significant probability of harmful environmental consequences; and
(3) development with the variance will result in water quality that is at least equal to the water quality achievable without the variance.
(B) The Land Use Commission may grant a variance from a requirement of Section 25-8-422 (Water Quality Transition Zone), Section 25-8-452 (Water Quality
Transition Zone), Section 25-8-482 (Water Quality Transition Zone), Section 25-8-652 (Restrictions on Development Impacting Lake Austin, Lady Bird Lake,
and Lake Walter E. Long), or Article 7, Division 1 (Critical Water Quality Zone Restrictions), after determining that:
(1) the criteria for granting a variance in Subsection (A) are met;
(2) the requirement for which a variance is requested prevents a reasonable, economic use of the entire property; and
(3) the variance is the minimum deviation from the code requirement necessary to allow a reasonable, economic use of the entire property.
(C) The Land Use Commission may not grant a variance from a requirement of Article 13 (Save Our Springs Initiative).
(D) The Land Use Commission shall prepare written findings of fact to support the grant or denial of a variance request under this section.
