(B)
about:blank 420/690
12/4/25, 4:54 PM Austin, TX Land Development Code
The director may grant a variance from a requirement of:
(1) Subsection 25-8-213(C) (Water Quality Control Standards);
(2) Section 25-8-261 (Critical Water Quality Zone Development), only if:
(a) necessary to protect public health and safety, or if the type of development requiring the variance directly contributes to a significant,
demonstrable environmental benefit, as determined by a functional assessment of floodplain health as prescribed by the Environmental Criteria
Manual;
(b) necessary to allow an athletic field in existence on October 28, 2013, to be maintained, improved, or replaced;
(c) necessary to allow an athletic field to be located in an area not otherwise allowed under Subsection 25-8-261(B)(5);
(d) necessary to allow a hard surfaced trail to be located in an area not otherwise allowed under Subsection 25-8-261(B)(3);
(e) necessary to allow the specified green stormwater infrastructure to be located in an area not otherwise allowed under Subsection 25-8-261(H); or
(f) except in the Barton Springs Zone, necessary to allow a private driveway or private street to cross a critical water quality zone if the crossing is
necessary to provide primary access to the right-of-way or the crossing is required to comply with public health and safety requirements.
(3) Section 25-8-261 (Critical Water Quality Zone Development), for development within an urban watershed, only if the proposed development:
(a) is located not less than 25 feet from the centerline of a waterway;
(b) is located outside the erosion hazard zone, unless protective works are provided as prescribed in the Drainage Criteria Manual;
(c) does not increase non-compliance, if any, with Article 7, Division 1 (Critical Water Quality Zone Restrictions), Section 25-8-281 (Critical
Environmental Features) or Section 25-8-282 (Wetland Protection); and
(d) restores native vegetation and soils if development is removed from the Critical Water Quality Zone;
(4) Subsection 25-8-262(B) (Critical Water Quality Zone Mobility Crossings), only outside the Barton Springs Zone;
(5) Section 25-8-281 (Critical Environmental Features);
(6) Section 25-8-322 (Clearing for a Roadway);
(7) Section 25-8-341 (Cut Requirements) or Section 25-8-342 (Fill Requirements), for a cut or fill of not more than eight feet:
(a) in the desired development zone; or
(b) for a public primary or secondary educational facility;
(8) Subsection 25-8-343(A) (Spoil Disposal);
(9) Section 25-8-365 (Interbasin Diversion); or
(10) Subsection 25-8-392(B)(6) (Uplands Zone), Subsection 25-8-392(C)(6) (Uplands Zone), Subsection 25-8-423(D) (Uplands Zone), or Subsection 25-8-453(E)
(Uplands Zone).
(C) It is the applicant's burden to establish that the findings described in this section have been met.
(D) The director may grant a variance described in Subsection (B) only after determining that development in accordance with the variance meets the
objective of the requirement for which the variance is requested and:
(1) for property in the Barton Springs Zone, the variance will result in water quality that is at least equal to the water quality achievable without the
variance;
(2) for a variance from Subsection 25-8-213(C), that the proposed water quality control is:
(a) necessitated by unique site conditions; or
(b) necessary to avoid a loss in residential units or building square footage;
(3) for a variance from Section 25-8-261, that the development is necessary to allow a private driveway or private street to cross a critical water quality
zone; The applicant must also demonstrate compliance with the following:
(a) The crossing must span the active channel or use open bottom culverts as determined by the director.
(b) In suburban watersheds, critical water quality zone buffer averaging must be applied to the extent feasible in order to minimize the area of the
private driveway within the critical water quality zone impacted by the crossing.
(c) The location of the crossing must minimize impacts to critical environmental features, protected and heritage trees, and slopes greater than 15%,
and must minimize the amount of cut or fill necessary for construction.
(d) The construction is not located in the Barton Springs Zone.
(4) for a variance from Subsection 25-8-261(B)(5), that the proposed work on or placement of the athletic field will have no adverse environmental
impacts;
(5) for a variance from Subsection 25-8-261(H), that the green stormwater infrastructure is:
(a) not required for regulatory compliance with 25-8-211 (Water Quality Control Requirement);
(b) designed to capture runoff from existing, untreated impervious cover; and
(c) proposed in a location that is the minimum necessary departure from the code requirement;

12/4/25, 4:54 PM Austin, TX Land Development Code
(6) for a variance from Section 25-8-281, that the proposed measures preserve all characteristics of the critical environmental feature;
(7) for a variance from Section 25-8-341 or Section 25-8-342, the cut or fill is not located on a slope with a gradient of more than 15 percent or within 100
feet of a classified waterway;
(8) for a variance from Subsection 25-8-343(A), use of the spoil provides a necessary public benefit. Necessary public benefits include:
(a) roadways;
(b) stormwater detention facilities;
(c) public or private park sites; and
(d) building sites that comply with Section 25-8-341 (Cut Requirements), Section 25-8-342 (Fill Requirements), and Chapter 25-7 (Drainage);
(9) for a variance from Section 25-8-365, there are no adverse environmental or drainage impacts; or
(10) for a variance from Subsection 25-8-392(B)(6), Subsection 25-8-392(C)(6), Subsection 25-8-423(D), or Subsection 25-8-453(E), the variance:
(a) is the minimum deviation needed to provide necessary improvements for a public mobility project in the right-of-way; and
(b) does not create significant adverse environmental impacts.
(E) The director shall prepare written findings to support the grant or denial of a variance request under this section.
