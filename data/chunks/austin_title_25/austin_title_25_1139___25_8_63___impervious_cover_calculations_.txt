(4) detention basins, excluding subsurface detention basins;
(5) ground level rainwater harvesting cisterns, excluding subsurface cisterns;
(6) drainage swales and conveyances;
(7) the water surface area of ground level pools, fountains, and ponds;
(8) areas with gravel placed over pervious surfaces that are used only for landscaping or by pedestrians and are not constructed with compacted base;
(9) porous pavement designed in accordance with the Environmental Criteria Manual, limited to only pedestrian walkways and multi-use trails, and
located outside the Edwards Aquifer Recharge Zone;
(10) fire lanes designed as prescribed by the Environmental Criteria Manual, that consist of interlocking pavers, and are restricted from routine vehicle

(b) the building official determines that the ramp will not pose a threat to public health and safety;
(c) the ramp:

(ii) may have a hand railing, but may not have a roof or walls; and
(d) the ramp is located in a manner that utilizes existing impervious cover to the greatest extent possible if:
(i) impervious cover on the property is at or above the maximum amount of impervious cover allowed by this title; or
(ii) if placement of the ramp would result in the property exceeding the maximum amount of impervious cover allowed by this title; and
(12) a subsurface portion of a parking structure if the director determines that:
(a) the subsurface portion of the structure:
(i) is located within an urban or suburban watershed;
(ii) is below the grade of the land that existed before construction of the structure;

adverse effects on public health and safety, the environment, and adjacent property; and
(13) for purposes of residential building permit review only, no more than two feet of elevated, projecting elements such as eaves, overhangs, cantilevered
portions of structures, balconies, awnings, and bay windows. This exemption does not apply to site plans or the calculation of the drainage charge
under Section 15-2-5 (Impervious Cover Calculation).
