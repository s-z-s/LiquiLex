§ 25-8-92 - CRITICAL WATER QUALITY ZONES ESTABLISHED.
(A) In the water supply rural watersheds, water supply suburban watersheds, and Barton Springs Zone, a critical water quality zone is established along each
waterway classified under Section 25-8-91 (Waterway Classifications).
(1) The boundaries of a critical water quality zone coincide with the boundaries of the 100-year flood plain as determined under Section 25-7-6
(Determination of the 100-Year Floodplain), except:
(a) for a minor waterway, the boundaries of the critical water quality zone are located not less than 50 feet and not more than 100 feet from the
centerline of the waterway;
(b) for an intermediate waterway, the boundaries of the critical water quality zone are located not less than 100 feet and not more than 200 feet from
the centerline of the waterway;
(c) for a major waterway, the boundaries of the critical water quality zone are located not less than 200 feet and not more than 400 feet from the
centerline of the waterway; and
(d) for the main channel of Barton Creek, the boundaries of the critical water quality zone are located 400 feet from the centerline of the creek.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsections (A)(1)(a), (b), and (c), a critical water quality zone does not apply to a drainage ditch located parallel and
adjacent to a railroad or public roadway right-of-way if the ditch:
(a) was designed and constructed primarily to serve the adjacent railroad or public roadway;
(b) is not a segment or modification of a natural waterway;
(c) does not possess any natural and traditional character; and
(d) cannot reasonably be restored to a natural condition due to existing site constraints.
(B) In the suburban watersheds, a critical water quality zone is established along each waterway classified under Section 25-8-91 (Waterway Classifications).
(1) For a minor waterway, the boundaries of the critical water quality zone are located 100 feet from the centerline of the waterway.
(2) For an intermediate waterway, the boundaries of the critical water quality zone are located 200 feet from the centerline of the waterway.
(3) For a major waterway, the boundaries of the critical water quality zone are located 300 feet from the centerline of the waterway.

(4) The critical water quality zone boundaries may be reduced to not less than 50 feet from the centerline of a minor waterway, 100 feet from the
centerline of an intermediate waterway, 150 feet from the centerline of a major waterway if the overall surface area of the critical water quality zone
is the same or greater than the surface area that would be provided without the reduction, as prescribed in the Environmental Criteria Manual.
(5) Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsections (B)(1), (2), and (3), a critical water quality zone does not apply to a drainage ditch located parallel and
adjacent to a railroad or public roadway right-of-way if the ditch:
(a) was designed and constructed primarily to serve the adjacent railroad or public roadway;
(b) is not a segment or modification of a natural waterway;
(c) does not possess any natural and traditional character; and
(d) cannot reasonably be restored to a natural condition due to existing site constraints.
(C) In an urban watershed, a critical water quality zone is established along each waterway with a drainage area of at least 64 acres. This does not apply in
the area bounded by IH-35, Riverside Drive, Barton Springs Road, Lamar Boulevard, and 15th Street.
(1) The boundaries of the critical water quality zone coincide with the boundaries of the 100-year floodplain as determined under Section 25-7-6
(Determination of the 100-Year Floodplain), provided that the boundary is not less than 50 feet and not more than 400 feet from the centerline of the
waterway.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection (C)(1), a critical water quality zone does not apply to a drainage ditch located parallel and adjacent to a
railroad or public roadway right-of-way if the ditch:
(a) was designed and constructed primarily to serve the adjacent railroad or public roadway;
(b) is not a segment or modification of a natural waterway;
(c) does not possess any natural and traditional character; and
(d) cannot reasonably be restored to a natural condition due to existing site constraints.
(D) Critical water quality zones are established to include the inundated areas that constitute Lake Walter E. Long, Lake Austin, Lady Bird Lake, and the
Colorado River downstream of Lady Bird Lake.
(E) Critical water quality zones are established along and parallel to the shorelines of Lake Travis, Lake Austin, Lady Bird Lake, and Lake Walter E. Long.
(1) The shoreline boundary of a critical water quality zone:
(a) for Lake Travis, coincides with the 681.0 foot contour line;
(b) for Lake Austin, coincides with the 492.8 foot contour line;
(c) for Lady Bird Lake, coincides with the 429.0 foot contour line; and
(d) for Lake Walter E. Long, coincides with the 554.5 foot contour line.
(2) The width of a critical water quality zone, measured horizontally inland, is:
(a) 100 feet; or
(b) for a detached single-family residential use, 75 feet.
(F) Critical water quality zones are established along and parallel to the shorelines of the Colorado River downstream of Lady Bird Lake.
(1) The shoreline boundary of a critical water quality zone coincides with the river's ordinary high water mark, as defined by Code of Federal Regulations
Title 33, Section 328.3 (Definitions).
(2) The inland boundary of a critical water quality zone coincides with the boundary of the 100-year floodplain as determined under Section 25-7-6
(Determination of the 100-Year Floodplain) except that the width of the critical water quality zone, measured horizontally inland, is not less than 200
feet and not more than 400 feet.
