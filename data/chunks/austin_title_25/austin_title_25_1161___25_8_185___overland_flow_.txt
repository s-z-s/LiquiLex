§ 25-8-185 - OVERLAND FLOW.
(A) Drainage patterns must be designed to:
(1) prevent erosion;
(2) maintain infiltration and recharge of local seeps, springs, and waterways;
(3) attenuate the harm of contaminants collected and transported by stormwater;
(4) where feasible, maintain and restore overland sheet flow, maintain natural drainage features and patterns, and disperse runoff back to sheet flow;
and
(5) where feasible, direct stormwater to landscape areas including islands, medians, peninsulas, and other similar areas. Exceptions to this requirement
include:
(a) perimeter landscape areas that are not required to drain to a stormwater control measure;
(b) impervious areas on which the land use or activity may generate highly contaminated runoff, as prescribed by the Environmental Criterial Manual;
and
(c) impervious areas used for parking or driving of vehicles if located within the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone.
(B) The applicant shall design an enclosed storm drain to mitigate potential adverse impacts on water quality by using methods to prevent erosion and
dissipate discharges from outlets. Applicant shall locate discharges to maximize overland flow through buffer zones or grass-lined swales wherever
practicable.
