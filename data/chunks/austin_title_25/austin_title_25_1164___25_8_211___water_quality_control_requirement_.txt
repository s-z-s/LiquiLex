§ 25-8-211 - WATER QUALITY CONTROL REQUIREMENT.
(A) In the Barton Springs Zone, water quality controls are required for all development.
(B) In a watershed other than a Barton Springs Zone watershed, water quality controls are required for development:
(1) located in the water quality transition zone;
(2) of a golf course, play field, or similar recreational use, if fertilizer, herbicide, or pesticide is applied; or
(3) if the total of new and redeveloped impervious cover exceeds 8,000 square feet.
(C) All new development must provide for removal of floating debris from stormwater runoff.
(D) The water quality control requirements in this division do not require water quality controls on a single-family or duplex lot but apply to the residential
subdivision as a whole.
(E) The water quality control requirements in this division do not require water quality controls for a roadway improvement with less than 8,000 square feet
of new impervious cover. For the purposes of this section, roadway improvements are limited to intersection upgrades, low-water crossing upgrades,
additions for bicycle lanes, and additions for mass transit stops.
(F) For a public mobility project in the right-of-way, the calculation of impervious cover for compliance with Subsection (B)(3) or Subsection (E) in any
watershed shall:
(1) be determined on a watershed basis for development applications that span multiple watersheds; and
(2) deduct existing impervious cover that is removed by the same project if the area with removed impervious cover is:
(i) decompacted and revegetated as prescribed in the Environmental Criteria Manual and the Standard Specifications Manual; and
(ii) located within the same watershed.
