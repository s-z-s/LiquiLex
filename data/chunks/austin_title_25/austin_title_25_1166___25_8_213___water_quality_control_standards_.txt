§ 25-8-213 - WATER QUALITY CONTROL STANDARDS.
(A) A water quality control must be designed in accordance with the Environmental Criteria Manual.
(1) The control must provide at least the treatment level of a sedimentation/filtration system under the Environmental Criteria Manual.
(2) An impervious liner is required for structural water quality controls over the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone. If a liner is required and there are
multiple controls in series, liners are only required for the first control in the series.
(3) The control must be accessible for maintenance and inspection as prescribed in the Environmental Criteria Manual.
(B) A water quality control must capture and treat the water draining to the control from the contributing area. The required capture volume is:
(1) the first one-half inch of runoff; and
(2) for each 10 percent increase in impervious cover over 20 percent of gross site area, an additional one-tenth of an inch of runoff.
(C) The required water quality treatment must be provided using green stormwater control measures, as prescribed in the Environmental Criteria Manual.
(D) Notwithstanding Subsection (C), all or part of the required water quality treatment may be provided using other water quality controls for:
about:blank 429/690
12/4/25, 4:54 PM Austin, TX Land Development Code
(1) areas with land uses or activities that may generate highly contaminated runoff, as described in the Environmental Criteria Manual;
(2) a project that provides water quality treatment for currently untreated, developed off-site areas of at least ten acres in size; or
(3) sites with impervious cover of greater than 90 percent gross site area.
(E) The location of a water quality control:
(1) must avoid recharge features to the greatest extent possible;
(2) must be shown on the slope map, preliminary plan, site plan, or subdivision construction plan, as applicable; and
(3) in a water supply rural watershed, may not be in the 40 percent buffer zone, unless the control disturbs less than 50% of the buffer, and is located to
maximize overland flow and recharge in the undisturbed remainder of the 40 percent buffer zone.
(F) This subsection provides additional requirements for the Barton Springs Zone.
(1) Approval by the Watershed Protection Department is required for a proposed water quality control that is not described in the Environmental Criteria
Manual. The applicant must substantiate the pollutant removal efficiency of the proposed control with published literature or a verifiable engineering
study.
(2) Water quality controls must be placed in sequence if necessary to remove the required amount of pollutant. The sequence of controls must be:
(a) based on the Environmental Criteria Manual or generally accepted engineering principles; and
(b) designed to minimize maintenance requirements.
