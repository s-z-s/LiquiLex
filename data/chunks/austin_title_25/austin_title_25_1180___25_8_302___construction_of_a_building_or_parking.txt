(A) A person may not construct:
(1) a building or parking structure on a slope with a gradient of more than 25 percent; or
(2) except for a parking structure, a parking area on a slope with a gradient of more than 15 percent.
(B) A person may construct a building or parking structure on a slope with a gradient of more than 15 percent and not more than 25 percent if the
requirements of this subsection are met.
(1) Impervious cover on slopes with a gradients of more than 15 percent may not exceed 10 percent of the total area of the slopes.
(2) The terracing techniques in the Environmental Criteria Manual are required for construction that is uphill or downhill of a slope with a gradient of
more than 15 percent.
(3) Hillside vegetation may not be disturbed except as necessary for construction, and disturbed areas must be restored with native and adapted
vegetation as prescribed in the Environmental Criteria Manual.
