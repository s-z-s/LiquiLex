§ 25-8-321 - CLEARING OF VEGETATION.
(A) Clearing of vegetation is prohibited unless the director determines that the clearing:
(1) is in accordance with a released site plan or subdivision construction plan;
(2) is permitted under this section or Section 25-8-322 (Clearing for a Roadway); or
(3) is not development, as that term is defined in Chapter 25-1 (General Requirements and Procedures).
(B) Clearing of vegetation for agricultural operations is prohibited if an application to develop for a non-agricultural use has been granted or is pending. The
director may waive this prohibition after determining that the clearing has a bonafide agricultural purpose and is unrelated to the proposed development
or sale of the land for non-agricultural uses.
(C) A person may clear an area up to 15 feet wide or remove a tree with a diameter of not more than eight inches to perform surveying or geologic testing in
preparation for site plan or final plat approval.
