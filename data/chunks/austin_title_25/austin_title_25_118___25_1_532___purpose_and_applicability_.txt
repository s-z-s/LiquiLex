§ 25-1-532 - PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY.
(A) This article establishes requirements for determining whether a project is entitled to vested rights under Chapter 245 or Section 43.002 of the Local
Government Code. To the extent a project is entitled to vested rights, as determined under this article, a permit necessary to initiate, continue, or

(1) Establish a clear and consistent process for evaluating vested rights claims;
(2) Ensure that vested rights determinations are based on accurate and complete information, including the nature and scope of the original project for
which vested rights are asserted and actual development, if any, that has occurred over time; and
(3) Recognize legitimate claims of vested rights under state law, while ensuring that new development complies to the greatest extent possible with
current regulations.
(C) The requirements of this article apply within the planning jurisdiction.
