§ 25-8-518 - LIMITED ADJUSTMENT TO RESOLVE POSSIBLE CONFLICTS WITH OTHER LAWS.
(A) This article is not intended to conflict with the United States Constitution or the Texas Constitution or to be inconsistent with federal or state statutes that
may preempt a municipal ordinance or the Austin City Charter.
(B) The terms of this article shall be applied consistently and uniformly. If a three-quarters majority of the city council concludes, or a court of competent
jurisdiction renders a final judgment concluding that this article, as applied to a specific development project or proposal violates a law described in
Subsection (A) of this section, the city council may, after a public hearing, adjust the application of this article to that project to the minimum extent
required to comply with the conflicting law. Any adjustment shall be structured to provide the maximum protection of water quality.
