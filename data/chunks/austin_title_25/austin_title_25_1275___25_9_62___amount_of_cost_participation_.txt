§ 25-9-62 - AMOUNT OF COST PARTICIPATION.
Tables 1 and 2 below set forth the percentage of cost participation in the hard costs of an oversized water or wastewater main. The percentage of cost
participation is based on the increased percentage in pipe diameter due to oversizing established under Section 25-9-64 (Request for Cost Participation). Cost
participation is determined by multiplying the percentage set forth in Table 1 and Table 2 by the hard costs of an oversized line.
(A) The following table sets forth the amount of cost participation for the hard costs associated with an oversized water main:
