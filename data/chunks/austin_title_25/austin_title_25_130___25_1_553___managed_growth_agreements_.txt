proposed expiration date, and must meet the requirements of this subsection.

the project associated with the proposed agreement:

circumstances, includes community benefits or superior development features that mitigate noncompliance with current regulations;

whatever expiration period the council deems appropriate, but may not waive or modify current regulations applicable to the project.
