§ 25-9-195 - UTILITY RATES IN A MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT.
(A) The consent of the City to the creation of a municipal utility district shall be conditioned on a contract between the City and the municipal utility district.
The contract must:
(1) include adequate detail as required by the laws of this state; and
(2) provide that at the time the City annexes the territory of the municipal utility district, water and wastewater rates established for property in the
municipal utility district shall be sufficient to fully compensate the City for assuming the indebtedness of the municipal utility district after the
municipal utility district is dissolved.
(B) A water or wastewater rate established under a contract required by Subsection (A) shall be based on the water or wastewater rate established for other
customers in the boundary of the City and shall include a component based on the monthly debt retirement payment assumed by the City. A water or
wastewater rate may be recalculated as provided in the contract.
(C) A water or wastewater rate established under a contract required by Subsection (A) must remain in effect until:
(1) the bonded indebtedness of the water district is fully retired; and
(2) the City is fully compensated, regardless of whether a bond of the water district is called.
(D) The written consent of the City to the creation of a municipal utility district shall specify the date by which at least 90 percent of the water, wastewater,
drainage, and road improvements for which bonds of the municipal utility district are issued must be installed or completed.
