§ 25-9-324 - COMPUTATION OF IMPACT FEES TO BE COLLECTED.
(A) The impact fees to be collected for new development are calculated by:
(1) adding the number of service units attributable to all meters purchased for the development;
(2) multiplying the total number of service units by the fee to be collected for each service unit for water or wastewater service; and
(3) subtracting any applicable credits or discounts allowable under this article for water or wastewater service from the product derived under
Subsection (A)(2).
(B) If the property owner increases the number of service units for a development, the additional impact fees to be collected for the new service units shall
be determined using the method set out in this section, and the fees and credits or discounts in effect at the time the additional meters are purchased.
The additional fee shall be collected at the time the additional meters are purchased.
(C) If the property owner decreases the number of service units for a development, the property owner is entitled to a refund of the impact fee for the
amounts represented by the decrease in service units based on the fee to be collected for each service unit and credits or discounts in effect at the time
the fee was paid.
