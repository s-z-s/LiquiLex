§ 25-9-334 - FIRE DEMAND METERS.
(A) No service units shall be attributed to a tap that provides only fire protection capacity.
(B) If a fire demand meter composed of a combination of independent units in separate housings monitoring both fire and domestic use is purchased, the
number of service units shall be determined according to the largest independent unit for the fire demand meter that provides only domestic service to
the property. For purposes of this section, only a simple or compound meter shall be used to calculate the number of service units.
(C) If the fire protection capacity of the fire demand meter is routinely used for domestic purposes, as evidenced by the registration of consumption
recorded on the City's meter-reading and billing systems, the owner of the property shall pay the current fee for the fire protection capacity that has been
converted to domestic capacity by routine use.
