§ 25-10-24 - ABATEMENT OF A HAZARDOUS SIGN.
(A) The building official shall give notice that abatement of a hazardous sign is required to the sign owner, sign user, or property owner. The notice must:
(1) be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, or hand-delivery; and
(2) include a statement that the building official may exercise the powers granted by Subsection (C) if the hazardous sign is not abated.
(B) The recipient of a notice described in Subsection (A) shall remove, modify, or repair the hazardous sign and abate the hazardous condition within a
reasonable period of time established by the building official, not to exceed 10 days after receipt of the notice.
(C) If the hazardous condition is not abated in accordance with Subsection (B), the building official may enter the premises and abate the hazardous
condition. The reasonable cost of abating the hazardous sign, together with interest on the unpaid balance at an interest rate of six percent, shall be
taxed as a lien against the record owner of the property on which the sign is located.
(D) If the building official removes a sign under Subsection (C), the building official shall retain the sign for at least 10 days before disposing of the sign. If
during this period the sign owner pays the storage fee established by the city council, the building official shall return the sign to its owner.
