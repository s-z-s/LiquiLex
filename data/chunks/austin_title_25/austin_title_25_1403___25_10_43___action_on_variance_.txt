§ 25-10-43 - ACTION ON VARIANCE.
(A) The Board of Adjustment may grant a variance from a requirement of this chapter after determining that granting the variance does not provide the
applicant with a special privilege not enjoyed by others similarly situated or potentially similarly situated; and
(1) the variance is necessary because enforcement of the requirement prevents any reasonable opportunity to provide adequate signs on the site,
considering the unique features of a site including its dimensions, landscaping, or topography;
(2) granting the variance will not have a substantially adverse effect on neighboring properties; or
(3) granting the variance will not substantially conflict with the purposes of this chapter.
(B) The Board of Adjustment shall hold a public hearing on an application for a variance not later than the 45th day after the date the application is filed.
