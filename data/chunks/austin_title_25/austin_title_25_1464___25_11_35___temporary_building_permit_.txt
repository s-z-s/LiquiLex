§ 25-11-35 - TEMPORARY BUILDING PERMIT.
(A) The building official may issue a temporary building permit to authorize construction of a portion of a building, structure, or building service equipment
before the plans and specifications for the entire project have been submitted or approved if the applicant files information and detailed statements
describing the activity to be performed and the building official determines that the activity complies with this title.
(B) The permittee under a temporary building permit proceeds with construction at the permittee's risk. A temporary building permit does not guarantee
that a permit for the entire building or structure will be approved. A permittee does not acquire vested rights under a permit issued under this section.
(C) The building official shall provide a permittee with written documentation stating that the permittee does not acquire vested rights under a temporary
building permit.
