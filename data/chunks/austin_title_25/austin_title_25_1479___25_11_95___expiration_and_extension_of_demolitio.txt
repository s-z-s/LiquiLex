§ 25-11-95 - EXPIRATION AND EXTENSION OF DEMOLITION PERMIT.
(A) Except as provided in Subsection (C) of this section, a demolition permit expires if:
(1) work authorized by the permit does not begin within two years from the date the permit is issued, except as provided in Subsection (C); or
(2) the demolition is not complete within six months from the date work begins.
(B) The building official may grant a single one-year extension of a demolition permit if the permittee requests the extension before the permit expires. An
extension must be requested in writing, but does not require an application.
(C) If a demolition permit expires after work has begun, a subsequent demolition permit issued for the same structure expires if the work is not complete
within six months or a lesser time if required by the building official based on public health and safety.
(D) An active demolition permit does not prevent expiration of a site plan under Chapter 25-5, Article 1, Division 5 (Expiration).
