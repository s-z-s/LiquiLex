minimum standards is to protect life and property, to resist damage from wildfires, and to reduce the spread of building and structure fires to wildland
fuels by providing a more ignition-resistant structure. Minimum standards vary based on proximity to the wildland fuels. These standards are intended to
provide, above Fire Code requirements, increased protection from the various levels of hazards in wildland-urban interface areas.

APPENDIX D. FUEL MODELS
As set forth in Section 3.2.1 of the Austin-Travis County Community Wildfire Protection Plan, fuel loads and fire behavior within the region are indicated by
the following vegetation:
1. Sparse, dry-climate grass, or grassland, is dominated by generally short grasses that may be sparse or discontinuous (Scott and Burgan 2005).
Pastures are also considered grasslands.

2. Aggrading juniper shrub fuel type is dominated by live oak-juniper and juniper savanna. It is present throughout the county. It includes both Ashe
juniper (Juniperus ashei), predominantly in western Travis County, and eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana), predominately in eastern Travis
County. Juniper scorch and mortality values by size class are nearly identical between these two Juniperus species (Engle and Stritzke 1995).
3. Closed juniper woodland has sufficient canopy closure to limit growth of tall grass (18 inches or more tall) to less than 50 percent of the ground cover.
Juniper, including Ashe juniper and/or eastern redcedar, and deciduous trees are the dominant vegetation types.
4. Mixed juniper hardwood forest fuel type is 25-percent juniper, 75-percent deciduous class.
