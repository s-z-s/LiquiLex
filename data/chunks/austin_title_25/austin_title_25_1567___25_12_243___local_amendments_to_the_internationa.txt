R202 Definitions
HEIGHT, BUILDING has the same meaning as "height" as defined in City Code Section 25-1-21(Definitions).
START OF CONSTRUCTION means the date a permit is issued for new construction or substantial improvements to existing structures if construction,
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement starts within 180 days from the date the permit is issued. Construction
starts when permanent construction of a building (including a manufactured home) is first placed and includes pouring a slab or footing, installing pilings,
about:blank 640/690
12/4/25, 4:54 PM Austin, TX Land Development Code
or constructing columns. Permanent construction does not include preparing land (clearing, excavating, grading, or filing); installing streets or walkways;
excavating for a basement, footing, pier, or foundation, erecting temporary forms or installing accessory buildings not occupied as dwelling units or not
part of the main building. For a substantial improvement, construction starts when a wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building is altered even
if the alteration does not affect the external dimensions of the building.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE means an amount of damage that results in restoration costs that equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT means any combination of repairs, alterations, reconstructions, rehabilitations, additions, or improvements to a building or
structure during the immediate 10-year period with cumulative costs that equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the
improvement or repair is started or, if the structure was damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. If the structure has sustained
substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed. Substantial improvement does
not include:
1. an improvement required to correct existing health, sanitary, safety code violations identified by the building official and that are the minimum
necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
2. an alteration to a historic structure if the alteration will not disqualify the structure from continuing its designation as a historic structure, which
means a structure that is listed or preliminarily determined eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, determined by the Secretary
of the United States Department of Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district, or a district preliminarily
determined to qualify as a historic district, or designated as historic under a State of Texas or local historic preservation program that is approved by
the United States Department of the Interior.
SURCHARGE means the vertical load imposed on retained soil that may impose a lateral force in addition to the lateral earth pressure of retained soil.
