a Reference to a code section includes all the relative subsections except as indicated in the table.
R503.1.1.1 Fenestration Alterations. Where new fenestration area is added to an existing building, the new fenestration shall comply with Section R402.4.
Where some or all of an existing fenestration unit is replaced with a new fenestration product, including sash and glazing, the replacement fenestration
unit shall meet the applicable requirements for U-factor and SHGC as specified in Table R402.1.3(1). Where more than one replacement fenestration unit is
to be installed, an area-weighted average of the U-factor, SHGC or both of all replacement fenestration units shall be an alternative that can be used to
show compliance.
CHAPTER 7 [RE] Residential Solar Ready
R701.1 Residential Solar Ready. New Residential Buildings must have a Solar-Ready Zone. The Solar-Ready Zone must not include areas shaded by parts of
the building or other obstructions.
R701.2 Obstructions.Solar-Ready Zones must be free from and not shaded by obstructions, including but not limited to vents, chimneys, parapets and
roof-mounted equipment.
R701.3 Electrical Service Reserved Space. The main electrical service panel must have a reserved space to allow installation of a dual pole circuit breaker
for future solar electric installation and must be labeled "For Solar Electric." The reserved space must be positioned at the opposite (load) end from the
input feed location or main circuit location. Wall area must have a reserved space to allow installation of an Austin Energy PV meter per the Austin Energy
Design Criteria manual.
R701.4 One-family and Two-family Dwellings. New detached one-family or two-family dwellings must have a total Solar-Ready Zone area of not less than
240 square feet (22.3 m 2 ) per dwelling, exclusive of required access or setback areas. The Solar-Ready Zone must be oriented between 90 and 300 degrees
of true North. The Solar-Ready Zone must comprise areas not less than six feet (1.83 m) on one side and at least one area of not less than 100 square feet
(9.29 m 2 ) exclusive of any required access or set back areas.
Exceptions:
1. A Building with less than 800 square feet (74.32 m 2 ) of roof area per dwelling unit.
2. A Building with a Solar-Ready Zone that is shaded by trees or adjacent structures for more than 50 percent of annual daylight hours.
3. A Building Site on which the applicant has demonstrated, through documentation, existence of a unique hardship preventing compliance.
4. New residential buildings with a permanently installed on-site renewable energy system with an output of not less than one watt per square foot
(0.092 m2) of conditioned floor area, or an on-site renewable energy system with a total output of at least two kilowatts.

R701.5 Townhouses. New Townhouses must have a total Solar-Ready Zone area of not less than 160 square feet (14.86 m 2 ) per townhouse unit, exclusive
of required access or setback areas. The Solar-Ready Zone must be oriented between 90 and 300 degrees of true North. The Solar-Ready Zone must
comprise areas not less than six feet (1.83 m) on a side and at least one area of not less than 100 square feet (9.29 m 2 ) exclusive of required access or set
back areas.
Exceptions:
1. Townhouses with less than 600 square feet (55.74 m 2 ) of roof area per townhouse unit.
2. A building with a Solar-Ready Zone that is shaded by trees or adjacent structures for more than 50 percent of annual daylight hours.
3. A Building Site on which the applicant has demonstrated, through documentation, existence of a unique hardship preventing compliance.
R701.6 Multifamily Buildings. New multifamily buildings of four stories or fewer must have a Solar-Ready Zone that is not less than 35% of the total roof
area of the building.
Exceptions:
1. A building with a Solar-Ready Zone that is shaded by trees or adjacent structures for more than 50 percent of annual daylight hours.
2. A Building Site on which the applicant has demonstrated, through documentation, existence of a unique hardship preventing compliance.
RJ101.1 Demand Responsive Water Heating. Electric storage water heaters with a rated water storage volume of 40 gallons (150 L) to 120 gallons (450 L)
and a nameplate input rating equal to or less than 12 kW shall be provided with demand responsive controls in accordance with Table RJ101.1.
Exceptions:
1. Water heaters that are controlled by a preprogrammed water heater timer. The timer shall be preprogrammed to turn the water heater off between
the hours of 3:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. from June 1 to September 30. The timer shall have a readily accessible override, as defined by the building
official, capable of restoring power to the water heater for one hour when activated. The timer shall be permanently programmed by the
manufacturer or locked to prevent alteration of the programming by the building occupants. Buildings that are accessory to a residential building are
considered residential buildings for the purposes of this section.
2. Water heaters that are capable of delivering water at a temperature of 180°F (82°C) or greater.
3. Water heaters that comply with Section IV, Part HLW or Section X of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.
4. Water heaters that use 3-phase electric power.
RK101.1 Electric readiness. Water heaters, household clothes dryers and cooking appliances that use fuel gas or liquid fuel shall comply with Sections
RK101.1.1 through RK101.1.5.
RK101.1.5 Water Heater Space. A space that is at least 3 feet (0.91 m) by 3 feet (0.91 m) wide by 7 feet (2.13) high shall be available surrounding or within 3
feet (0.91 m) of the installed water heater.
Exceptions:
1. Installed heat pump water heaters.
2. Water heaters serving multiple dwelling units in a R-2 occupancy.
