"For SI: 1 foot = 304.8 mm
NR = Not Required.
ci = continuous insulation.",
"a The values in this table apply to repairs, renovations, or additions that increase the conditioned floor area by no more than 40 percent. All
other construction shall use the values for new construction in Table R402.1.3(2).",
"b R-values are minimums, U-factors and SHGC are maximums. When insulation is installed in a cavity which is less than the label or design
thickness of the insulation, the installed R-value of the insulation shall not be less than the R-value specified in the table.",
"c ""5ci or 13"" means R-5 continuous insulation (ci) on the interior or exterior surface of the wall or R-13 cavity insulation on the interior side of
the wall. ""10ci or 13"" means R-10 continuous insulation (ci) on the interior or exterior surface of the wall or R-13 cavity insulation on the interior
side of the wall. ""15ci or 19 or 13&5ci"" means R-15 continuous insulation (ci) on the interior or exterior surface of the wall; or R-19 cavity
insulation on the interior side of the wall; or R-13 cavity insulation on the interior of the wall in addition to R-5 continuous insulation on the
interior or exterior surface of the wall.",
"d The first value is cavity insulation, the second value is continuous insulation (ci) or insulated siding. Therefore, as an example, ""13&2ci"" means
R-13 cavity insulation plus R-2 continuous insulation or insulated siding. Where R-13&2ci is used, non-insulated structural sheathing shall cover
no more than 25% of the exterior.",
e Slab insulation shall be installed in accordance with Section R402.2.10.1.,
f Basement wallinsulation is not required in Warm Humid locations as defined by Figure R301.1 and Table R301.1.,
