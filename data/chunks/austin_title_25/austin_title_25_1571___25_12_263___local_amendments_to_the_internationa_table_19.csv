For SI: 1 foot = 304.8 mm,
NR = Not Required.,
ci = continuous insulation.,
"a R-values are minimums. U-factors and SHGC are maximums. When insulation is installed in a cavity which is less than the label or design
thickness of the insulation, the installed R-value of the insulation shall not be less than the R-value specified in the table.",
"b ""5ci or 13"" means R-5 continuous insulation (ci) on the interior or exterior surface of the wall or R-13 cavity insulation on the interior side of
the wall. ""10ci or 13"" means R-10 continuous insulation (ci) on the interior or exterior surface of the wall or R-13 cavity insulation on the interior
side of the wall. ""15ci or 19 or 13&5ci"" means R-15 continuous insulation (ci) on the interior or exterior surface of the wall; or R-19 cavity
insulation on the interior side of the wall; or R-13 cavity insulation on the interior of the wall in addition to R-5 continuous insulation on the
interior or exterior surface of the wall.",
