"c The first value is cavity insulation, the second value is continuous insulation (ci) or insulated siding. Therefore, as an example, ""13&2ci"" means
R-13 cavity insulation plus R-2 continuous insulation or insulated siding. Where R-13&2ci is used, non-insulated structural sheathing shall cover
no more than 25% of the exterior."
d Slab insulation shall be installed in accordance with Section R402.2.10.1.
e Basement wall insulation is not required in Warm Humid locations as defined by Figure R301.1 and Table R301.1.
"f Air-impermeable insulation of R-25&0 or greater may be used if mechanical equipment and air distribution system are located entirely within
the building thermal envelope. ""Air-impermeable"" shall be defined as having an air permeance not exceeding 0.02 L/s-m 2 at 75 Pa pressure
differential tested according to ASTM E 2178 or ASTM E 283."
g R-0&25ci continuous insulation can be used where the insulation is completely above the roof framing and sub-roofing.
"h Mass walls shall be in accordance with Section R402.2.6. The second R-value applies where more than half of the insulation is on the interior
of the mass wall."
