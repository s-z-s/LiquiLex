"a A ducted return is a duct made of sheet metal or flexible duct that connects one or more return grilles to the return-side inlet of the air-
handling unit. Any other method to convey air from return or transfer grille(s) to the air-handling unit does not constitute a ducted return for
the purpose of determining maximum total duct system leakage allowance.",,
";i \ i; Duct systemtesting is permitted where space conditioning equipment is not installed, provided the return ductwork is installed, and the measured leakage from the supply and
return ductwork is included.",,
"c For duct systems to be considered inside a conditioned space, where the ductwork is located in ventilated attic spaces or unvented attics with
vapor diffusion ports, duct system leakage to outside must comply with Item 2.1 of Section R403.3.4.",,
"d Prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, where the air-handling unit is not verified as being located in conditioned space, the total
duct system leakage must be re-tested.",,
