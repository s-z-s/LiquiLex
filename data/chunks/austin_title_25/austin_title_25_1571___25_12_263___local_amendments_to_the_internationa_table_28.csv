"Mechanical
ventilation rate","The mechanical ventilation rate shall be in addition to the air leakage
rate and shall be the same as in the proposed design, but not greater
than B x M where:
B = 0.01 x CFA + 7.5 x (N + 1), cfm.
br
M = 1.0 where the measured air leakage rate is ≥ 3.0 air changes per
hour at 50 Pascals, and otherwise, M = minimum (1.7, Q/B)
Q = the proposed mechanical ventilation rate, cfm.
CFA = conditioned floor area, ft 2
N = number of bedrooms.
br","The measured mechanical ventilation rate b , Q,
shall be in addition to the measured air leakage
rate."
"Mechanical
ventilation fan
energy","The mechanical ventilation system type shall be the same as in the
proposed design. Heat recovery or energy recovery shall be modeled
for mechanical ventilation where required by Section R403.6.1. Heat
recovery or energy recovery shall not be modeled for mechanical
ventilation where not required by Section R403.6.1.
Where mechanical ventilation is not specified in the proposed design.
None
Where mechanical ventilation is specified in the proposed design,
annual vent fan energy use, in units of kWh/yr, shall equal:
(8.76 x B x M)/e
f
where:
B and M are determined in accordance with the air exchange
mechanical ventilation rate row of this table.
e = the minimum exhaust fan efficacy, as specified in Table R403.6.2,
f
corresponding to the system type at a flow rate of B x M",As proposed
Internal gains,"IGain, in units of Btu/day per dwelling unit, shall equal 17,900 + 23.8 x
CFA + 4,104 x N where:
br
CFA = conditioned floor area, ft 2 .
N = number of bedrooms.
br",Same as standard reference design.
Internal Mass,"An internal mass for furniture and contents of 8 pounds per square
foot of floor area","Same as standard reference, plus any additional
mass specifically designed as a thermal storage
element c but not integral to the building thermal
envelope or structure"
"Structural
mass","For masonry floor slabs, 80% of floor are covered by R-2 carpet and
pad, and 20% of floor directly exposed to room air.",As proposed
,"For masonry basement walls: as proposed, but with insulation as
specified in Table R402.1.3, located on the interior side of the walls.",As proposed
,"For other walls, for ceilings, floors, and interior walls, wood frame
construction.",As proposed
