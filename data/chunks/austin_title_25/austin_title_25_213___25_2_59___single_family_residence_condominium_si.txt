§ 25-2-59 - SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCE CONDOMINIUM SITE (SF-4B) DISTRICT DESIGNATION.
Single-family residence condominium site (SF-4B) district is the designation for a moderate density single-family residential use on a site surrounded by existing
structures, most of which are single-family residences. An SF-4B district use is subject to development standards that maintain single family neighborhood
characteristics. An SF-4B district designation may only be applied to a use at a proposed location if the existing use at the location is designated as an urban family
(SF-5) or less restrictive district.
