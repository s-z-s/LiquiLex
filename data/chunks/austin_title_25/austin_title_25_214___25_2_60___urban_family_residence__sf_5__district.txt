§ 25-2-60 - URBAN FAMILY RESIDENCE (SF-5) DISTRICT DESIGNATION.
Urban family residence (SF-5) district is the designation for a moderate density single-family residential use on a lot that is a minimum of 5,750 square feet. A
duplex, two-family, townhouse, or condominium residential use is permitted in an SF-5 district under development standards that maintain single family
neighborhood characteristics. An SF-5 district designation may be applied to a use in an existing family residential neighborhood in a centrally located area of the
City. An SF-5 district may be used as a transition between a single family and multifamily residential use or to facilitate the implementation of City affordable
housing programs.
