§ 25-2-102 - WAREHOUSE/LIMITED OFFICE (W/LO) DISTRICT DESIGNATION.
Warehouse/limited office (W/LO) district is the designation for an office or warehouse use for a building trade or other business that does not require a highly
visible location or generate substantial volumes of heavy truck traffic, that generates low or moderate vehicular trips, and that requires less access than a retail use.
A W/LO district use may require special measures to be compatible with adjacent uses. A W/LO district use may be located on a site that is adjacent to or near an
arterial or major nonresidential collector street, adjacent to a rail line, or near existing or proposed employment uses. A W/LO district use may also be located on a
site that functions as a transition between commercial and industrial uses. A W/LO district use may be located adjacent to a residential use only if the density of the
residential development is higher than a typical single-family density or if the physical conditions of the site allow for buffering and project design to mitigate
potential adverse effects.
