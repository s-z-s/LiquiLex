§ 25-2-144 - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD) DISTRICT DESIGNATION.
(A) Planned unit development (PUD) district is the designation for a large or complex single or multi-use development that is planned as a single contiguous
project and that is under unified control.
(B) The purpose of a PUD district designation is to preserve the natural environment, encourage high quality development and innovative design, and ensure
adequate public facilities and services for development within a PUD.
(C) A PUD district designation provides greater design flexibility by permitting modifications of site development regulations. Development under the site
development regulations applicable to a PUD must be superior to the development that would occur under conventional zoning and subdivision
regulations.
(D) A PUD district must include at least 10 acres of land, unless the property is characterized by special circumstances, including unique topographic
constraints.
