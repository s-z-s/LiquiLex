§ 25-1-87 - SEQUENCE OF REVIEW.
(A) An application may not be placed on a board or commission agenda unless staff review is finished and a staff recommendation is available for board or
commission consideration. This requirement does not apply if staff review is not finished by the deadline prescribed by this title.
(B) An application may not be placed on the Land Use Commission or council agenda unless recommendations from all other boards and commissions
required to review the application are available for Land Use Commission or council consideration. The responsible director may waive this requirement if
the responsible director determines that:
(1) a board or commission did not review the application in a reasonable period of time; and
(2) the delay is attributable to the board or commission and not the applicant.
