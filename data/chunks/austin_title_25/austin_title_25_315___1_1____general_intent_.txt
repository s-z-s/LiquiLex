§ 1.1. - GENERAL INTENT.
This division provides the procedures and minimum requirements for a planned unit development (PUD) zoning district to implement the goals of preserving the
natural environment, encouraging high quality development and innovative design, and ensuring adequate public facilities and services. The Council intends PUD
district zoning to produce development that achieves these goals to a greater degree than and that is therefore superior to development under conventional zoning
and subdivision regulations.
