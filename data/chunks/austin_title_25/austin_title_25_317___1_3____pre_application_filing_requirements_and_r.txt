§ 1.3. - PRE-APPLICATION FILING REQUIREMENTS AND REVIEW CRITERIA.
1.3.1. Report and Finding Required.
The requirements of this section must be fulfilled before the Neighborhood Planning and Zoning Department may accept an application for a PUD zoning district
classification.
A. The applicant must obtain a project assessment report on the proposed development from the director of the Neighborhood Planning and Zoning
Department. Not later than the 11th day after issuance of the report, the director shall mail notice of the report to the neighborhood plan contact
team and those entitled to notice under Section 25-1-133(A) (Notice of Applications and Administrative Decisions).
B. The director of the Neighborhood Planning and Zoning Department must present the project assessment report at a council meeting and make
recommendations regarding the requirements in Section 2.3 (Tier One Requirements), the criteria in Section 2.4 (Tier Two Requirements), and any
other applicable requirements or criteria. Not later than the 11th day before the date of the meeting, the director of the Neighborhood Planning and
Zoning Department shall mail notice of the meeting to those entitled to receive notice of the project assessment report.
1.3.2. Council Response.
The council or individual council members may supplement or respond to the recommendation of the director of the Neighborhood Planning and Zoning
Department with comments identifying issues that should or must be addressed during subsequent review and consideration of the application. A comment does
not obligate council members to vote for or against approval of the proposed PUD district zoning.
1.3.3. Baseline for Determining Development Bonuses.
A. Unless the council establishes a different baseline as part of a comment under Section 1.3.2 (Council Response), the baseline for determining
development bonuses under Section 2.5 (Development Bonuses) is determined by:
(1) the regulations of the base zoning district, combining district, and overlay district; and
(2) any other applicable site development standards.
B. The director may recommend an alternate baseline for the property. Council may approve the director's recommendation or other baseline it
determines is appropriate.
C. Any bonuses granted under a combining district or overlay district may only be used to determine the baseline if the project complies with the
requirements for the bonuses and the bonuses can be achieved without violating any other applicable site development standards.
