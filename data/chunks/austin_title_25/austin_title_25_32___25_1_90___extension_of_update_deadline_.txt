§ 25-1-90 - EXTENSION OF UPDATE DEADLINE.
This section does not apply to a preliminary plan, plat, or subdivision construction plan. For all other development applications:
(A) If the time required for staff review of an application exceeds the review time established by the director under Section 25-1-82 (Non-Subdivision
Application Requirements and Expiration), the responsible director shall extend the deadline for submitting an update to the application by the
number of days that staff exceeded the established review time. The responsible director shall notify the applicant of the new deadline for submitting
an update.
(B) An applicant who is not entitled to an automatic extension under Subsection (A) of this section may request that the responsible director extend a
deadline for submitting an update to an application, other than an application for a site plan, subdivision, or subdivision construction plan, in
accordance with this subsection.
(1) A request for an extension under this subsection must be filed with the responsible director in writing before expiration of the deadline
established by the director under Section 25-1-82 (Non-Subdivision Application Requirements and Expiration) and must include a justification for
the request.
(2) The responsible director must give notice under Section 25-1-133(B) (Notice of Applications and Administrative Decisions) of an extension request
under this subsection.
(3) The responsible director may grant an extension request under this subsection if the responsible director determines that good cause exists for
the extension. An extension period may not exceed the length of the original time period for submitting an update to the application.
(4) An interested party may appeal the responsible director's decision under this subsection to the Land Use Commission.
