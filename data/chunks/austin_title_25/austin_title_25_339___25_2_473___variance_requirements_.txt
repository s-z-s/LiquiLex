§ 25-2-473 - VARIANCE REQUIREMENTS.
(A) A variance from the requirements of this chapter, or a Neighborhood Conservation Combining District adopted under this chapter, may be granted under
this division if, because of special circumstances of a property, the strict application of this chapter deprives the property owner of privileges that are
enjoyed by another person who owns property in the area that has the same zoning designation as the property for which the variance is requested.
(B) A variance to a regulation may not grant special privileges that are inconsistent with the limitations on other properties in the area or on the district in
which the property is located.
