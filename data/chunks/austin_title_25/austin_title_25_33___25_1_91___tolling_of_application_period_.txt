§ 25-1-91 - TOLLING OF APPLICATION PERIOD.
(A) This section establishes a "stop the clock" provision tolling the expiration period for an application that requires discretionary review by the Land Use
Commission, Board of Adjustment, or city council.
(B) The expiration of an application is tolled if, prior to expiration of the application, the director determines that:
(1) discretionary review, as authorized under this title, by the Land Use Commission, Board of Adjustment, or city council, other than a zoning change or
code amendment; and
(2) the application meets all other requirements for approval, except for payment of fees, posting fiscal surety, and other code requirements as
determined by the director under Section 25-1-82 (Non-Subdivision Application Requirements and Expiration), 25-1-83 (Preliminary Plan or Plat
Application Requirements and Expiration), or 25-1-84 (Subdivision Construction Plan Application and Requirements).
(C) If an applicant obtains all required discretionary approvals from the Land Use Commission, Board of Adjustment, or city council, any additional updates of
the application must be submitted no later than 60 working days after the date of the approval. An application expires if the applicant does not comply
with this deadline.
(D) An application expires if the Land Use Commission, Board of Adjustment, or city council denies a required discretionary approval or fails to take action
after considering the matter at a public hearing.
(E) If expiration of an application is tolled under this section pending required approval by the Land Use Commission, Board of Adjustment, or city council,
the expiration period for all other applications associated with the same project is also tolled.
