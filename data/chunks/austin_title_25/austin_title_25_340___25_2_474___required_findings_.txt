§ 25-2-474 - REQUIRED FINDINGS.
(A) The Board of Adjustment may grant a variance from a requirement if it determines that:
(1) the requirement does not allow for a reasonable use of property;
(2) the hardship for which the variance is requested is unique to the property and is not generally characteristic of the area in which the property is
located; and
(3) development under the variance does not:
(a) alter the character of the area adjacent to the property;
(b) impair the use of adjacent property that is developed in compliance with the City requirements; or
(c) impair the purposes of the regulations of the zoning district in which the property is located.
(B) The Board may grant a variance from a loading facility or off-street parking design requirements if, in addition to the findings required by Subsection (A),
the Board determines that:
(1) current or anticipated traffic volume generated by the use of the property or a nearby property does not reasonably require strict compliance with
and enforcement of the requirement from which a variance is requested;

(3) development under the variance does not create a safety hazard or any other condition that is inconsistent with the objectives of the Code.
(C) A variance granted under Subsection (B) applies only to the use for which the variance was granted and does not run with the land on which the use is
located.
