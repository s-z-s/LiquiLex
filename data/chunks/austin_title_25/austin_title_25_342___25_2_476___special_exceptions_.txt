§ 25-2-476 - SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS.
(A) The Board of Adjustment shall grant a special exception for an existing residential structure, or portion of an existing structure, that violates a setback
required under Chapter 25-2 (Zoning) if the board finds that the special exception meets the requirements of this section.
(B) The Board shall grant a special exception under Subsection (A) of this section if:
(1) the residential use for which the special exception is sought is allowed in an SF-3 or more restrictive zoning district;
(2) the building official performs an inspection and determines that the violation does not pose a hazard to life, health, or public safety; and
(3) the Board finds that:
(a) the violation has existed for:
(i) at least 25 years; or
(ii) at least 10 years, if the application for a special exception is submitted on or before June 6, 2017;
(b) the use is a permitted use or a nonconforming use;
(c) the structure does not share a lot with more than one other primary residence; and

(1) applies only to the structure, or portion of a structure, for which the special exception was granted and does not run with the land;
(2) may not authorize an increase in the degree of noncompliance or excuse compliance with minimum health and safety requirements; and
(3) may not authorize a remodel or addition to the existing structure, except to the extent required by the building official to meet minimum life and
safety requirements.
(D) A structure granted a special exception under this section shall be treated as a non-complying structure under Chapter 25-2, Article 8 (Noncomplying
Structures).
