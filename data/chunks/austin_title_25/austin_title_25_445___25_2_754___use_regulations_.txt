(5) Each multistory building must be served by an elevator, unless:

(D) Local uses are permitted in any base district, subject to the limitations of this subsection.

(b) is zoned historic and has a permitted building height of 65 feet or greater.
(2) Except as provided in Paragraph (3), up to 20 percent of the gross floor area of a site may be used for local uses. At least one-half of the gross floor
area of the local uses must be located at street level and accessible from a pedestrian path. In determining these percentages, a nonresidential use
that is accessory to the principal residential use or located in a historic landmark is excluded from the gross floor area of the local uses.
(3) Up to 100 percent of the gross floor area of a structure may be used for local uses if the structure:
(a) is a historic landmark and is located entirely in a subdistrict having a permitted building height of 65 feet or greater;
(b) was constructed before September 13, 2004, contains less than 10,000 square feet of gross floor area, is less than 65 feet in height, and is located
in the inner west campus or Guadalupe subdistricts; or
(c) is less than 65 feet in height and located on:
(i) Guadalupe Street between Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd. and 29th Street;

(b) prohibited in the outer west campus subdistrict.
(3) The street level portion of a commercial off-street parking structure that is accessible from a pedestrian path must contain local uses for a depth of at
least 18 feet. This requirement does not apply to a portion of the structure used for an entrance or exit.
(F) A cocktail lounge is a conditional use if it is accessory to a hotel-motel use with at least 50 rooms.
(G) On-site surface parking is prohibited, unless the director determines that:
(1) the only building on the site has 6,000 or fewer square feet of gross floor area, and the building was constructed before September 13, 2004; and
(2) the parking area is screened from the street by an six foot tall solid wall.
(H) This subsection prescribes requirements for the ground floor of a building, including a parking garage.
(1) The ground floor must include occupant space along not less than 75 percent of the net length of street frontage. Net length of street frontage is
calculated by determining the cumulative length of the building at ground level adjacent to each street other than an alley, and then deducting the
cumulative length of driveways, exit stairs, elevators, and utility equipment space.
(2) For a site with frontage on more than one street, driveways, exit stairs and elevators must be located on a street that runs north and south, unless the
director of the Neighborhood Planning and Zoning Department determines that those features cannot reasonably be located along that street
because of topographical conditions.

ground floor adjacent to an alley.
(4) The minimum distance between the finished ground floor of the building and the structural portion of the ceiling is 10 feet.
(5) The minimum depth of occupant space is 18 feet, measured from the outside face of the front exterior wall to the outside face of the rear interior

500 feet from the construction site if the director determines that a closer staging area is not reasonably available and that the location does not
adversely affect public health or safety.
