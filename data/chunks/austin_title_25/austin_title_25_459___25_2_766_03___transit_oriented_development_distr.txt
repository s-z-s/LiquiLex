§ 25-2-766.03 - TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT ZONES DESCRIBED.
(A) A transit oriented development (TOD) district may be divided into zones of varying development intensity, as described in this section.
(B) A gateway zone is the area immediately surrounding the station platform, where passengers enter or exit transit vehicles. Typically, this area includes
land that is about 300 to 500 feet from the edge of the station platform. This zone has a high level of transit integration, including streetscapes that
connect the station platform with the surrounding buildings, and buildings that are oriented toward the station platform and provide ground floor
pedestrian-oriented uses and employment or residential uses in the upper floors. A gateway zone has the highest density and building height in a TOD
district.
(C) A midway zone is the area between a gateway zone and a transition zone, beginning at the outer boundary of the gateway zone and ending
approximately 1,000 to 1,500 feet from the edge of the station platform. This zone is predominately residential, but it may also contain retail and office
uses. The zone includes a variety of building types. A midway zone has density and building height that are lower than a gateway zone but higher than a
transition zone.
(D) A transition zone is the area at the periphery of the TOD district. Development intensity is compatible with the existing or anticipated future development
adjacent to the TOD district. A transition zone has the lowest density and building height in a TOD district.
