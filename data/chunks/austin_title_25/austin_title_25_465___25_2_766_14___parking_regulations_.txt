§ 25-2-766.14 - PARKING REGULATIONS.
(A) For a building with a front yard setback of 15 feet or less, parking is prohibited in the area between the front lot line and the building. The director of the
Neighborhood Planning and Zoning Department may modify this requirement if the director determines that:
(1) the modification is required to protect a historic structure or a tree designated as significant by the city arborist; or
about:blank 172/690
12/4/25, 4:54 PM Austin, TX Land Development Code
(2) the modification allows an alternative development design that is compatible with and supportive of public transit and a pedestrian-oriented
environment and that complies with the TOD district principles and best practices established by administrative rule.
(B) For a rear parking lot on a site larger than three acres, the parking lot must be designed to permit future driveway and sidewalk connections with
adjacent non-residential property. The director may waive this requirement if the director determines:
(1) the connections are impractical because of site constraints;
(2) the connections are inappropriate because of traffic safety issues; or
(3) the site's land use is incompatible with the land use of the adjacent property.
