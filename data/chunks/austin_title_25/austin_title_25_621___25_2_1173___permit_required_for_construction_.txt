otherwise allowed under Section 25-5-2 (Site Plan Exemptions), and building permit and pays the applicable fees established by ordinance. A site plan
required under this section must be signed and sealed by a licensed professional engineer and must include all information required by the director
responsible for administering this chapter.
(B) A permit obtained under this section shall be prominently displayed at the construction site until the final inspection and approval by the building official.
