§ 25-2-1175 - LIGHTING AND ELECTRICAL REQUIREMENTS.
(A) A dock must be lighted as provided in this section and in compliance with Chapter 25-12, Article 4 (Electrical Code). This section does not apply to a dock
located on an inlet or slough, unless the dock is on Bee Creek or Bull Creek.
(B) This subsection applies to a dock that extends more than eight feet from the shoreline. In this subsection, the distance that a dock extends from a
shoreline is measured perpendicular to the shoreline.
(1) A dock must be continuously lighted with amber lights between sunset and sunrise each day.
(2) A dock must have at least one light station. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the light station must be located on the end of the dock
and on the side that is farthest from and parallel to the shoreline. The light must be visible to a properly approaching watercraft.
(3) A dock that extends 30 feet or more from the shoreline, or that has a shoreline frontage of 25 feet or more, must have at least one light station on
each side of the dock that does not face the shoreline.
(4) The requirements of this paragraph apply if the director determines that a dock described in Subsection (B)(3) may be a navigational hazard between
sunset and sunrise.
(a) A dock that extends less than 50 feet from the shoreline must have a light station halfway between the shoreline and the end of the dock that is
farthest from the shoreline.
(b) A dock that extends 50 feet or more from the shoreline must have light stations from the shoreline to the end of the dock at intervals of not more
than 25 feet, except that a light station may not be located within 8 feet of the shoreline.
(c) A dock that has a shoreline frontage of at least 25 feet but less than 50 feet must have a light station located at each end of the dock on the side
farthest from the shoreline.
(d) A dock that has a shoreline frontage of 50 feet or more must have light stations located at intervals of not more than 25 feet along its frontage.
(e) Light stations are required at each end of the dock on the side farthest from the shoreline.
(C) A light station required by this section must have a two-bulb fixture, with two working light bulbs that emit at least 112 lumens and not more than 400
lumens. Light bulbs or bulb covers must be amber, and white light may not radiate from the fixture. Weatherproof lamp holders and junction boxes are
required. Each light fixture must be wired with a switch operated by a photoelectric cell so that the lights will operate automatically during the hours that
the dock is required to be lighted by this section.
(D) Wiring on a dock must be enclosed in rigid conduit or weatherproof flexible conduit with appropriate fittings.
(E) If lights other than those required by this section are installed on a dock, only an amber navigation light may cast a beam of light outward from the dock.
(F) A dock that requires lights under this section must provide temporary navigation lights that meet the requirements of this section during construction
and until the permanent navigation lights installed on the dock are working.
(G) If a dock does not comply with this section, the building official or other authorized city official shall post notice on the dock and shall notify the owner by
mail of the violation. An offense under this section is punishable by a fine of not less than $200.
