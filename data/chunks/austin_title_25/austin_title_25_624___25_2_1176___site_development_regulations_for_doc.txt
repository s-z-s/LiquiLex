A dock may extend up to 30 feet from the shoreline, except that the director may require a dock to extend a lesser or greater distance from the shoreline if deemed
necessary to ensure navigation safety.
(2) No portion of a dock shall extend more than 20% of a channel width as measured by a line that is perpendicular to the centerline of the channel and
that extends from the shoreline where the dock is located to the opposite shoreline.
(3) A dock may not be constructed closer than 10 feet to the side property line, regardless of the side-yard setback generally applicable within the base
zoning district.
(4) The width of a dock measured parallel to the shoreline of the lot or tract where the dock is proposed, and including all access and appurtenances,
may not exceed:
(a) 20 percent of the shoreline frontage, if the shoreline width exceeds 70 feet;
(b) 14 feet, if the shoreline frontage is no greater than 70 feet.
(5) The footprint of a dock, including the portion of a cut-in slip, attached access structures, or roof overhang, may not exceed:
(a) 1,200 square feet for a dock that is accessory to a principal residential use;
(b) for a cluster dock, 600 square feet multiplied by:
(i) the number of dwelling units in a multifamily development; or
(ii) the number of principal residential structures in a subdivision, if:
the dock will be located in a common area that fronts Lake Austin or Lady Bird Lake; and
lots within the subdivision have perpetual use rights to the common area.
(6) A dock may not exceed 30 feet in height as measured from the highest point of the structure above the normal pool elevation of the lake.
(7) No portion of a dock may be enclosed, except for an enclosed storage closet that is:
(a) limited to no more than 48 square feet for each principal residential use associated with the dock; and
(b) oriented to minimize cross sectional area perpendicular to flow.
(8) The dock must be designed and constructed to meet the following requirements:
(a) except for storage closets permitted under Paragraph (7), all solid structural supports and other materials used for enclosure, including lattice,
wire panels, seat walls, and screening, must be at least 66 percent open, except that mesh for insect screening that is at least 66 percent open will
not count toward the total enclosure percentage;
(b) no framing materials that are capable of being converted to support walls or windows may be used; and
(c) percentage of required openness is calculated per side, with the assumed height of eight feet per floor when no roof is proposed.
(9) The number of motorboats anchored, moored, or stored on a dock may not exceed:
(a) two, for a principal residential use utilizing an individual dock that is not part of a cluster dock; or
(b) the number of single-family or multifamily residential units that:
(i) have a perpetual right to use of a cluster dock located in a common area of the residential subdivision or multi-family development; and
(ii) do not utilize a dock other than a cluster dock.
(10) For purposes of determining the total number of motorboats that may be anchored, moored, or stored on a dock or over water, one personal
watercraft is equivalent to one-half of a motorboat.

(1) A parking lot or permanent structure, other than a dock or a combined storage area on the water's edge, must be set back at least 100 feet from the

(2) is constructed of smooth wire or mesh;
(3) extends no more than 40 feet beyond the shoreline;
