§ 25-2-1224 - SEWAGE DISPOSAL.
(A) The owner or licensee of a mobile home park shall provide an adequate and safe sewerage system to convey and dispose of sewage.
(B) The sewer system and any sewer lines for a park must be constructed in compliance with the City's plumbing code. A proposed sewage disposal facility
must be approved by the Health Authority before construction. Unless specific prior approval is obtained from the Health Authority and the Texas Natural
Resource Conservation Commission, sewage treatment effluent may not be discharged into any waters of the state.
(C) The owner or licensee of a park shall provide each mobile home stand with one sewer riser pipe with a minimum diameter of four inches. The sewer riser
pipe and other sewer connections shall be installed and maintained in compliance with the plumbing code. The sewer riser pipe must be located on a
mobile home stand in a manner that causes the sewer connection to the mobile home drain outlet to approximate a vertical position. The owner or
licensee of a park shall plug the sewer riser pipe on a mobile home space when no mobile home occupies the space and divert surface drainage away
from the riser.
