element on building façades. Projects subject to this section shall meet the following minimum requirements, but may provide additional glazing and façade relief
beyond what is required under this section. Refer to Article 5 for definitions of Glazing and Façade Relief.
A. On the façade facing the roadway or Internal Circulation Route where building frontage is provided under the requirements of this Subchapter:
1. 40 percent of the wall area below ten feet as measured from the finish floor level of this façade's entry shall consist of glazing unless topography,
distance or other physical characteristics remove the façade from a close physical connection to the roadway or Internal Circulation Route (See
