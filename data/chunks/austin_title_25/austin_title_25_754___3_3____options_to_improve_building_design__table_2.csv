Develop VMU building,"While VMU buildings are exempted from the requirements of this
section, points are assigned for the purpose of aggregating point
values for the mixed use development bonuses described in Article 4.
In addition to the three base points associated with the VMU
development, one additional point is added if the gross square
footage of the VMU building contains a combination of at least 25%
residential and 25% office or retail uses. However, no points may be
earned for a building that contains external trademarked design
features (not including signs)."
