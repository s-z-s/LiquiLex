Types of Mixed Use Development
"Within the districts that allow mixed use development, uses may be combined either vertically in the same building, or horizontally in multiple
buildings, or through a combination of the two, depending on the standards of the district."
"Vertical mixed use is allowed in two building types: the Vertical Mixed Use (VMU) Building and the Neighborhood Mixed Use (NMU) Building.
Standards for VMU buildings are in Section 4.3. below, and standards for NMU buildings are in Subchapter D, Article 6."
"Horizontal mixed use is the mixing of uses in a development project, though not necessarily in the same building. Horizontal mixed use is
allowed and encouraged in Austin so long as each of the proposed uses is allowed within the applicable zoning district and the development
meets all applicable requirements of the Austin Code."
