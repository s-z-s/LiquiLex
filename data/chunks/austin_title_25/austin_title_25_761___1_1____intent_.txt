12/4/25, 4:54 PM Austin, TX Land Development Code
This Subchapter is intended to minimize the impact of new construction, remodeling, and additions to existing buildings on surrounding properties in residential
neighborhoods by defining an acceptable buildable area for each lot within which new development may occur. The standards are designed to protect the character
of Austin's older neighborhoods by ensuring that new construction and additions are compatible in scale and bulk with existing neighborhoods.
