§ 2.3. - FRONT YARD SETBACK.
A. Minimum Setback Required. The minimum front yard setback required for development subject to this Subchapter is the lesser of:
1. The minimum front yard setback prescribed by the other provisions of this Code; or
2. The average front yard setback, if an average may be determined as provided in Subsection B. below.
B. Average Front Yard Setback. The following rules apply for purposes of the setback calculation required by Paragraph A.2:
1. A front yard setback is the distance between the front lot line and the closest front exterior wall or building façade of the principal residential
structure located on the lot.
2. Except as provided in paragraph 3, average front yard setback is determined using the front yard setback of the four principal residential structures
that are: (a) built within fifty feet of the front lot line; and (b) closest to, and on the same side of the block, as the property subject to the setback
required by this section.
3. If less than four structures satisfy the criteria in paragraph B.2, average front yard setback is calculated using the number of existing residential
structures on the same side of the street block as the property subject to the setback required by this section. If there are no structures on the same
side of the block, average front yard setback is calculated using the front yard setbacks of the four structures on the opposite side of the block that
are closest to the property subject to the setback required by this section. If there are less than four structures on the opposite side of the block, the
lesser number of structures is used in the calculation. See Figure 1.
Figure 1: Average Front Yard Setback
In this example, the minimum required front setback in the underlying zoning district is 25 feet. However, because of the variety in existing setbacks of
buildings on the same block face, new development on lot C may be located with a setback of only 20 feet, which is the average of the setbacks of lots B, D,
and E. The building on lot A is not included in the average because it is located more than 50 feet from the property line.
