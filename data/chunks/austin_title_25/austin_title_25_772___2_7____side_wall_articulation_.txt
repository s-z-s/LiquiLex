§ 2.7. - SIDE WALL ARTICULATION.
2.7.1.
Except as provided in subsection 2.7.2, if a side wall of a building is more than 15 feet high and is an average distance of less than nine feet from an interior lot line,
the sidewall may not extend in an unbroken plane for more than 36 feet along a side lot line without a sidewall articulation that meets the requirements of this
section.
A. To beak the plane, a sidewall articulation must:
1. be perpendicular to the side property line, at least four feet deep, and extend along the side property line for at least 10 feet, as shown in Figures
18 through 20;
2. extend the entire height of the first floor of an addition to, or remodel of, an existing one-story building;
3. extend the entire height of the second story of an addition to, or remodel of, a two or more story building;
4. extend to the height of the top floor of a newly constructed building; and
5. extend evenly upward for its entire height.
B. A sidewall articulation cannot:
1. create patios or decks or be screened from view; or
2. serve as an eave or gutter.
C. Sidewall articulation required under this section may be satisfied by horizontal articulation, such that each story above the first story is setback
further from the property line by at least nine feet and extends along the side property line for at least 10 feet.
D. For purposes of subsection 2.7.1, wall height:
1. excludes side gables; and
2. is measured from the lower of natural or finished grade adjacent to the structure up to the first floor wall plate, which is the lowest point of the
existing first floor ceiling framing that intersects the exterior wall.

The requirements of this section do not apply to:
A. Any side of a structure that is adjacent to a commercial use, unless the commercial use is occupying a residential structure.
B. An addition to or remodel of an existing principal structure, or the construction of a new principal structure, provided that the resulting structure is
less than 2,000 square feet in net building coverage and less than or equal to 32 feet in height.
C. An addition to or remodel of an existing second structure, or the construction of a new second structure, provided that the principal structure is
exempt under subsection 2.7.2.B and the resulting second structure:
1. does not exceed 550 square feet;
2. does not exceed the maximum height allowed in the base zoning district; and
3. is either detached from the principal structure or connected by a covered breezeway that is open on all sides, with a walkway of no more than six
(6) feet in width that is covered by a roof of no more than eight (8) feet in width.
D. The addition of a second story to an existing one-story structure if the addition is directly above a portion of the existing one-story structure that was
originally constructed, or received a permit for construction, before October 1, 2006.
E. An extension of the second floor of an existing two-story structure, provided that the building footprint of the structure is not increased.
Figure 18: Side Wall Articulation (Existing Side Wall Exceeds 36 Feet)
Articulation is required for side walls on additions or new construction that are 15 feet or taller and located within 9 feet of the side lot line. No wall may
extend for more than 36 feet without a projection or recession of at least 4 feet in depth and 10 feet in length.
Figure 19: Side Wall Articulation (Existing Side Wall Less Than or Equal to 36 feet)
An addition to an existing building may extend a side wall up to a maximum of 36′ in total length without articulation.
