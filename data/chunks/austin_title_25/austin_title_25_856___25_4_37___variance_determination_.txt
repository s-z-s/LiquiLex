§ 25-4-37 - VARIANCE DETERMINATION.
(A) The Land Use Commission shall grant a variance from a requirement of Article 3 if the Land Use Commission determines that enforcement of the
requirement will make subdivision of a tract of land impractical and deny the owner all reasonable use of the land.
(B) For a mass housing project, a planned unit development, or similar neighborhood unit, the Land Use Commission may grant a variance from a
requirement of Article 3 (Platting Requirements) if the Land Use Commission determines that planned development will provide light and air, vehicular
and pedestrian circulation, and recreational facilities that are at least equal to the requirements of this title. An applicant must provide the Land Use
Commission with a written report documenting compliance with this subsection.
