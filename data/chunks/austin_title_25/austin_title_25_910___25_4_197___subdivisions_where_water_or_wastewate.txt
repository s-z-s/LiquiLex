§ 25-4-197 - SUBDIVISIONS WHERE WATER OR WASTEWATER SERVICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE.
(A) A plat may not be approved unless the subdivider has complied with the requirements of this section, if applicable.

may be obtained from surface or subsurface sources on the land. The evidence may include the results of tests and borings, and statements from local
and state health authorities, water engineers, and other competent authorities. If the subdivider proposes a private water supply for the subdivision, the
plans and specification shall be prepared by a registered professional engineer and approved by the director of the Water and Wastewater Utility and the
Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission.
(C) If a subdivision is not to be served by a sanitary sewer utility and the use of private on-site sewage facilities has not been approved by the local health
authority, the subdivider shall construct a community sewage collection and treatment system that serves each lot. The system must be designed and
located in accordance with the regulations of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission and the local health authority. Approval by the
director of the Water and Wastewater Utility of the plans for the system is required.
