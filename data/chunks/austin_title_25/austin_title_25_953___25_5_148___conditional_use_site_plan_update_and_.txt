§ 25-5-148 - CONDITIONAL USE SITE PLAN UPDATE AND EXPIRATION.
(A) If the Land Use Commission, or the council on appeal, imposes a condition of approval on a conditional use site plan, the applicant shall file with the
director an update that satisfies the condition not later than 20 business days after the site plan approval date. A site plan expires if the applicant does
not comply with the deadline.
(B) After receiving the update, the director shall notify the applicant of review comments to an updated conditional use site plan not later than the deadline
established by the director under Section 25-1-82 (Application Requirements and Expiration).
(C) An applicant may file a subsequent update to a conditional use site plan not later than 135 business days after the date of site plan approval. If the site
plan on file after that date does not comply with the requirements of this title or a condition of approval, the site plan approval expires.
(D) The director shall deny a conditional use site plan that expires under this section.
