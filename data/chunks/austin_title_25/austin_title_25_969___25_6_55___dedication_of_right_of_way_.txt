§ 25-6-55 - DEDICATION OF RIGHT-OF-WAY.
(A) If the director determines that dedication of right-of-way is needed to accommodate the transportation system, the applicant may be required to
dedicate the amount of land determined to be roughly proportionate to the development under Section 25-6-5 (Proportionality of Required
Infrastructure) or a lesser amount, as determined by the director based on the adequacy of the transportation system.
(B) The director may defer the dedication of right-of-way required at one stage of the development process to a later stage. A person must comply with all
dedication requirements before the release of the subsequent application.
