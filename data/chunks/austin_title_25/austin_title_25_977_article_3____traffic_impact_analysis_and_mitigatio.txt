If a proposed development does not require an impact analysis under Section 25-6-113 (Traffic Impact Analysis Described) or Section 25-6-114 (Neighborhood
Traffic Impact Analysis Described), the director may condition approval of the application on construction or funding of system improvements as described in this
subsection:
(1) System improvements are limited to:
(a) sidewalks and curb ramps;
(b) traffic signs, markings, and upgrades to signal infrastructure;
(c) traffic calming devices;
(d) bike lanes or upgrades to bike facilities;
(e) rectangular rapid flashing beacons;
(f) pedestrian refuge islands;
(g) pedestrian hybrid beacons;
(h) urban trail improvements;
(i) right-of-way dedications; and
(j) measures to limit transportation demand.
(2) System improvements required under this section must be located:
(a) within the boundaries of the development for which they are required; or
(b) no farther from the proposed development than:
(i) one-quarter mile; or
(ii) three-fourths of a mile, for an improvement required to provide access between the proposed development and a school, bus stop, public
space, or major roadway as designated under the transportation plan.
(C) If a proposed development requires a traffic impact analysis under Section 25-6-113 (Traffic Impact Analysis) or Section 25-6-114 (Neighborhood Traffic
Impact Analysis), the director may require an applicant to construct or fund system improvements identified by the traffic impact analysis.

(1) the applicant's roughly proportionate share of infrastructure costs as established by the proportionality determination required under Section 25-6-
23 (Proportionality Of Required Infrastructure), less the cost of any right-of-way dedication required under Section 25-6-55 (Dedication of Right-of-
Way); or
