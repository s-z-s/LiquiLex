An application is not entitled to development\nrights if it is unrelated to or inconsistent with the original project or if the original project has been completed, changed, or expired.\n(2) Review Criteria. In determining whether a petition meets the standard for approval under this subsection, the director shall consider the following\nfactors:\n(a) The nature and extent of proposed development shown on the prior permit or other application that initiated the project for which vested rights\nare claimed;\n(b) Whether the permit application submitted in connection with the vested rights petition is related to and consistent with the original project;\n(c) The nature and extent of prior development of the property, including any permitting or construction activity that occurred subsequent to the\nvesting date requested by the applicant;\n(d) Any prior vested rights determinations made for development of the property; and\n(e) Whether the project has expired in accordance with Division 3 (Expirations) of this article or other applicable regulations.\n(B) The director shall review a Type 2 (Continuing Use) petition for vested rights under the criteria described in this subsection.\n(1) General Standard. A permit application is entitled to use rights under Section 43.002 of the Local Government Code to the extent that current\nregulations would prohibit:\n(a) continuing to use the land in the manner in which it was being used on the date the annexation proceedings were instituted, if the land use was\nlegal at that time; or\n(b) beginning to use land in the manner that was planned before the 90 th day before the effective date of the annexation if:\n(i) one or more licenses, certificates, permits, approvals, or other forms of authorization by a governmental entity were required by law for the\nplanned land use; and\n(ii) a completed application for the initial authorization was filed with the governmental entity before the date the annexation proceedings were\ninstituted.\n(2) Review Criteria. In determining whether a petition meets the standard for approval under this subsection, the director shall consider the nature and\nextent of development that:\n(a) occurred on the property prior to initiation of annexation proceedings, including photographs or other evidence substantiating the use; or\n(b) was proposed in one or more required applications submitted to a governmental entity.\n(3) Date of Annexation. For purposes of this subsection, annexation proceedings are deemed to have been instituted on the date of the first public\nhearing before the city council on the annexation ordinance for the property.\n(C) The criteria in this section are intended to assist the director in reviewing Type 1 (Chapter 245) and Type 2 (Continuing Use) petitions for vested rights, but\ndo not limit the director from considering other factors relevant to the determination of rights for a particular project.

These designations\nmay be modified as set out under state law.\n(B) The dwelling unit factor shall be:\n(1) .005 for multi-family units; and\n(2) .004 for rooms in a hotel or motel ordinarily used for sleeping.\n(C) The density factor shall be:\n(1) one for the suburban area;\n(2) four for the urban area; and\n(3) forty for the central business district area.\n(D) Every 10 years, the City will use the average land value for each geographic area calculated by the applicable appraisal district. For the years in which the\napplicable appraisal district does not calculate the average land value, the City shall calculate the average land value for each geographic area by\nmultiplying the previous year's average land value for each geographic area by one plus the average CPI for each month of the previous year.\n(E) If the director has determined that an applicant will satisfy their parkland dedication requirements entirely by paying a parkland dedication fee, the dollar\namount required is calculated using the following formula:\n{[(# of multifamily units) \u00d7 .005] + [(# of hotel/motel rooms) \u00d7 .004]} \u00d7 (Avg Land Value of Geographic Area)/Density Factor\n(1) First, add the product of the number of multifamily units proposed to be developed by .005 and the product of the number of hotel and motel rooms\nordinarily used for sleeping proposed to be developed by .004.\n(2) Then, multiply the sum calculated under Subdivision (E)(1) by the average land value for the geographic area where the development is located.\n(3) Finally, divide the number calculated under Subdivision (E)(2) by the applicable density factor.\n(F) If the director has determined that an applicant is satisfying their parkland dedication requirements through dedicating land and paying a parkland\ndedication fee, the dollar amount of parkland dedication fee owed is calculated using the following formula:\n[Parkland dedication fee per Subsection (E)] - [(Applicable land value) \u00d7 (# of acres)]\n(1) First, calculate the amount of fee using the formula described in Subsection (E).\n(2) Then, subtract the product of the land value applicable to the land and the number of acres dedicated from the total amount of the parkland\ndedication fee.\n(G) If the applicant is dedicating land and paying a reduced fee, the applicant will only be required to dedicate for development approval an acreage amount\nthat has a land value that does not exceed the amount of parkland dedication fee calculated under this section. Additionally, the acreage amount shall\nnot exceed 10% of gross site area of the development.\n(H) If there is a remaining amount of parkland dedication fee after subtracting the land value of the acreage required to be dedicated as parkland, the\napplicant may choose to construct recreational facilities on the future parkland in lieu of paying the remaining parkland dedication fee amount. The\nrecreational facilities must be shown on the subdivision or site plan application and constructed before the land is dedicated.\nSource: Ord. No. 20231130-087, Pt. 2, 1-1-24.",

No. 20160505-051, Pt. 1, 5-16-16.\nSUBCHAPTER E: - DESIGN STANDARDS AND MIXED USE.\nEditor's note:\nBackground: On February 26, 2004, the Austin City Council directed the City Manager by resolution \"\u2026 to prepare recommendations for citywide design\nstandards for commercial and retail development. These recommended citywide design standards shall constitute the best practices of the standards adopted by\ncommunities around the nation and shall require design standards that reflect Austin's unique historic, landscape and architectural character\u2026\"\nIn order to implement the Council's direction, a specially appointed Task Force met over several months to consider research and input from the public, various\nstakeholder groups, and individuals. The Task Force sought to understand the preferences of Austin citizens and the design regulations of other cities prior to\ndeveloping a recommendation.\nThe Task Force produced, and in May 2005 the City Council adopted, a policy report entitled \"Raising the Design Standards in Austin, Texas.\" The Task Force\nreport identified a number of areas where regulatory improvements are necessary in order to raise the bar of development quality in Austin. The general intent was\nto develop regulations that will foster a built environment of aesthetic and sustainable value, enhance economic development efforts, promote Austin's unique\ncharacter and natural environment, and ensure an efficient development review process.\nThe proposals for new standards were intended to raise the level of quality for all non-residential and mixed-use development, but within a regulatory structure\noffering options and flexibility, not strict requirements. New development would be subject to a set of minimum site and building design standards, recognizing that\nall new development, regardless of size, should be subject to minimum standards. The following topics were addressed in the Task Force report: Development\norientation; Parking; Land use; Signs; Stormwater management; Connectivity; Exterior lighting; Screening and compatibility; and Building design.\nabout:blank 250/690\n12/4/25, 4:54 PM Austin, TX Land Development Code\nIn each of these topic areas, the Task Force report discussed the key issue generally and proposed regulatory language to address the issue. In a few areas,\nspecific ordinance language was proposed, but in most areas the proposed language recommended general approaches rather than actual ordinance language. In\nsome areas, the proposed new standards would be new for Austin, while in other areas the proposed standards would require amendments to the Austin Code.\nThis Subchapter is intended to implement the Task Force report by establishing a clear, user-friendly, and legally enforceable ordinance that will result in\nimproved development quality in Austin. This Subchapter is officially known as Subchapter E of Chapter 25-2 of the City Code. This Subchapter was adopted on\nAugust 31, 2006, and will become effective on January 13, 2007. The Task Force recommends reviewing this Subchapter once it has been in place for one year.\nHow to use this Subchapter:\nApplicability is Based on Adjacent Roadway and Type of Development: This Subchapter recognizes that development should reflect and respond to its location\nwithin the city. For example, a commercial development in a suburban location can (and often should) look and function differently than a commercial development\nin downtown Austin. Because roadways provide both access to a site and define the urban design framework of the city, roadway types have been used as an\norganizing tool to establish many of the new development standards in this Subchapter. This approach is intended to help ensure a cohesive development pattern\nalong Austin's streets and remove some of the inconsistency that arises from having a variety of zoning districts fronting a single roadway.\nBecause many of the standards in this Subchapter are defined based on roadway type(s) near the property, an important first step in the development process is\nto determine the roadway types that are adjacent to a site. The size of the site and the type of development (residential, commercial, mixed use, etc.) also need to\nbe considered, since different standards may apply. The applicability chart in Article 1 summarizes the applicability of all the standards in this Subchapter, based on\ntype of adjacent roadways and development activity.\nThe following different types of roadways are identified in this Subchapter:\nCore Transit Corridors include roadways that have or will have a sufficient population density, mix of uses, and transit facilities to encourage and support transit\nuse. Existing Core Transit Corridors have been designated and are defined in Article 5 and shown on Figure 1. Examples include South Congress Avenue (north of\nStassney Lane) and Anderson Lane (between Burnet Road and Mopac). Additional Core Transit Corridors may be designated in the future through neighborhood\nplanning processes.\nHill Country Roadways are those roadways identified in Section 25-2-1103, such as RM 2222 and Southwest Parkway. Standards in this Subchapter that reference\nthe Hill County Roadway designation apply to all properties within 1000 feet of these roadways.\nHighways include all freeways, parkways, expressways, and frontage roads identified in the Austin Area Metropolitan Transportation Plan, except for Core Transit\nCorridors.\nInternal Circulation Routes are public streets or private drives edged by a curb within a development.\nSuburban Roadways are roads outside the Urban Roadway Boundary, defined below and shown on Figure 2, that are not Core Transit, Hill Country, or Highway\nRoadways.\nUrban Roadways are roads other than those designated as Core Transit Corridors and Highways located within the following boundaries, as shown on Figure 2:\n183 from Burnet to Hwy 71\nHwy 71 from 183 to Loop 1\nLoop 1 from Hwy 71 to Lake Austin\nLake Austin from Loop 1 to Exposition\nExposition from Lake Austin to 35th\n35th from Exposition to Loop 1\nLoop 1 from 38th to RM 2222\nRM 2222 from Loop 1 to Mesa\nMesa from RM 2222 to Spicewood Springs Road\nSpicewood Springs Road from Mesa to 360\n360 from Spicewood Springs Road to Great Hills Trail\nGreat Hills Trail from 360 to 183\n183 from Great Hills Trail to Braker\nBraker from 183 to Burnet\nBurnet from Braker to 183\nabout:blank 251/690\n12/4/25, 4:54 PM Austin, TX Land Development Code\nFigure 1: Core Transit Corridors (CTC) and Future Core Transit Corridors Map (May 10, 2010)\nabout:blank 252/690\n12/4/25, 4:54 PM Austin, TX Land Development Code\nFigure 2: Urban/Suburban Roadways Map\nHow this Subchapter is organized:\nThis Subchapter is divided into five Articles.\nArticle 1 includes General Provisions that should be reviewed for all development and redevelopment projects. Most importantly, a chart summarizes the\napplicability of the various standards based on roadway types and development types.\nTo allow flexibility in administering this Subchapter, this Article includes a \"minor modification\" provision that allows for City staff to approve small deviations\nfrom otherwise applicable standards in order to protect natural or historic features or to address unique site conditions.\nThe Article also encourages creativity and innovative design by allowing an applicant to propose an alternative approach to meeting the standards of the\nSubchapter through the \"alternative equivalent compliance\" provision.\nArticle 2 includes Site Development Standards intended to ensure that buildings relate appropriately to surrounding developments and streets, promote efficient\npedestrian and vehicle circulation, and provide parking in safe and appropriate locations, while creating a unique and identifiable image for development in Austin.\nIn particular, standards in this Article address the following:\nRelationship of buildings to streets and walkways (based on roadway type);\nConnectivity (based on roadway type);\nExterior lighting;\nScreening of equipment and utilities; and\nPrivate common open space and pedestrian amenities.\nArticle 3 includes Building Design Standards intended to address the physical appearance of buildings subject to this Subchapter. Included are:\nGeneral requirements for glazing and shading to ensure that building fa\u00e7ades are pedestrian-friendly; and\nAdditional options to improve building design. An applicant may choose which of these options to meet from a flexible, point-based menu. All buildings\nsubject to this section must reach a minimum number of points, with additional points required for certain building types (e.g., buildings with\ntrademarked design features, large buildings or long fa\u00e7ades, and buildings using a large percentage of certain building materials.)\nabout:blank 253/690\n12/4/25, 4:54 PM Austin, TX Land Development Code\nArticle 4 includes standards and incentives for Mixed Use development. This Article includes descriptions and standards for the Mixed Use Combining District and\nthe Vertical Mixed Use Overlay District. This Article also includes standards and incentives for the development of Vertical Mixed Use (VMU) buildings.\nArticle 5 includes Definitions for terms used in this Subchapter.\nSource: Ord.

    "text_content": "\u00a7 1.4. - MINOR MODIFICATIONS.\n1.4.1. Purpose and Scope.\n\"Minor modifications\" are small deviations from otherwise applicable standards of this Subchapter that may be approved by the Director in order to protect natural\nor historic features or to address unusual site conditions. Minor modifications are to be used when the limited nature of the modification requested, and the\nunlikelihood of any adverse effects on nearby properties or the neighborhood, make it unnecessary to complete a formal variance process.\n1.4.2. Applicability.\nThe Director may approve minor modifications of any numeric development standard in this Subchapter up to a maximum of ten percent (or up to a maximum of\n20 percent to protect an existing natural site feature), provided that the applicable criteria in Section 1.4.4 (Approval Criteria) are met.\nFor a Heritage Tree, the Director may approve modification of any numeric development standard in this Subchapter to the minimum extent required to preserve\nthe Heritage Tree.\nA modified development standard is calculated by applying the percentage of modification allowed by the Director to the numeric requirement that would\notherwise apply if the development standard was not modified. For example, if a building fa\u00e7ade is required to have 40% glazing, which would equal 400 square feet\nglazing on a 1000-square foot fa\u00e7ade, then a 10% minor modification would decrease the amount of required glazing by 40 square feet for a total of 360 square feet\nof required glazing. The minor modification process may be used only to authorize a less restrictive standard and may not be used to impose a standard on the\nsubject property than is higher than otherwise provided in this Subchapter. In no circumstance shall the Director approve a minor modification that results in:\nA. An increase in overall project intensity, density, or impervious cover;\nB. A change in permitted uses or mix of uses;\nC. A change in the requirements of any of the following provisions:\n1. Subchapter C, Article 3 (Additional Requirements for Certain Districts);\n2. Subchapter C, Article 4 (Additional Requirements for Certain Uses);\n3. Subchapter C, Article 10 (Compatibility Standards); or\nD. A change in conditions attached to a subdivision plan, site plan, special use permit, or restrictive covenant approved by the City.\n1.4.3. Procedure.\nThe Director may initiate or approve a minor modification allowed under this section at any time prior to submittal of the staff report on the application to another\ndecision-making body or prior to final decision if the Director is the final decision-maker. The Director shall specify any approved minor modifications and the\njustifications for such modifications on the pending development application for which the modifications were sought.\n1.4.4. Approval Criteria.\nThe Director may approve a minor modification from the terms of this Subchapter only upon finding that the modification meets all of the criteria below:\nA. The requested modification is in general conformity with the stated purposes of this Subchapter;\nB. The requested modification meets all other applicable zoning, building, drainage, water quality, and safety code requirements;\nC. The requested modification will have no significant adverse impact on the health, safety, or general welfare of surrounding property owners or the\ngeneral public, or such impacts will be substantially mitigated; and\nD. The requested modification is necessary to compensate for some practical difficulty or some unusual aspect of the site of the proposed development\nnot shared by landowners in general.\nSource: Ord. 20060831-068; Ord. 20100408-049; Ord. 20130606-088.",

Purpose and Scope.\nabout:blank 258/690\n12/4/25, 4:54 PM Austin, TX Land Development Code\nTo encourage creative and original design, and to accommodate projects where the particular site conditions or the proposed use prevent strict compliance with\nthis Subchapter, alternative equivalent compliance allows development to occur in a manner that meets the intent of this Subchapter, yet through an alternative\ndesign that does not strictly adhere to the Subchapter's standards. The procedure is not a general waiver of regulations. Alternative equivalent compliance shall not\nbe used when the desired departure from the standards of this Subchapter could be achieved using the minor modification process in Section 1.4.\n1.5.2. Applicability.\nThe alternative equivalent compliance procedure shall be available only for the following sections of this Subchapter:\nA. Section 2.2, Relationship of Buildings to Streets and Walkways;\nB. Section 2.3, Connectivity Between Sites;\nC. Section 2.5, Exterior Lighting;\nD. Section 2.7, Private Common Open Space and Pedestrian Amenities;\nE. Section 2.8, Shade and Shelter; and\nF. Article 3, Building Design Standards.\n1.5.3. Procedure.\nThe applicant may select at his or her discretion whether to seek an informal recommendation or a formal approval on a proposal for alternative compliance.\nA. Option One: Informal Recommendation.\n1. Pre-Application Conference Required. If an applicant desires only an informal response and recommendation as to a proposal for alternative\ncompliance, he or she shall request and attend a pre-application conference prior to submitting the site plan and/or building permit application\nfor the development. At the conference, the applicant shall provide a written summary of the project and the proposed alternative compliance,\nand the Director shall offer an informal, non-binding response and recommendation regarding the appropriateness of the proposed alternative.\nBased on that response, the applicant may prepare a site plan and/or building permit application that proposes alternative compliance, and such\napplication shall include sufficient explanation and justification, in both written and graphic form, for the alternative compliance requested.\n2. Decision-Making Responsibility. Final approval of any alternative compliance proposed under this section shall be the responsibility of the\ndecision-making body responsible for deciding upon the application. The final decision-making body for site plans is either the Director or the\nappropriate Land Use Commission, as specified in Chapter 25-5, and the building official for building permits.\n3. Decision by Director. If an Alternative Equivalent Compliance proposal is submitted under this subsection the Director shall review the concept\nplan for compliance with the criteria in Section 1.5.4. and shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the concept plan in writing.\nB. Option Two: Formal Decision.\n1. Pre-Application Conference. If an applicant desires formal approval of a proposal for alternative compliance, he or she shall request and attend a\npre-application conference prior to submitting the site plan and/or building permit application for the development.\n2. Alternative Compliance Concept Plan Required. At least ten days prior to the pre-application conference, the applicant shall submit an\nalternative compliance concept plan application to the Director, which shall include:\na. A written description of and justification for the proposed alternative method of compliance, specifically addressing the criteria in Section\n1.5.4.; and\nb. A concept plan that describes and illustrates, in written and graphic format, the intended locations and quantities of proposed buildings on\nthe site, the layout of proposed vehicle and pedestrian access and circulation systems, and areas designated to meet requirements for open\nspace, parking, on-site amenities, utilities, and landscape. The concept plan shall describe the site's topography and shall provide a general\ndescription of environmental characteristics to assist in determining compliance with this Subchapter. If alternative compliance is requested\nfrom the standards of Article 3, Building Design, the concept plan also shall include descriptions and illustrations of the proposed building\ndesign elements that would not comply with the standards of this Subchapter.\n3. Decision by Director. If an Alternative Equivalent Compliance proposal is submitted under this subsection the Director shall review the concept\nplan for compliance with the criteria in Section 1.5.4. and shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny the concept plan in writing.\n4. Expiration of Alternative Compliance Concept Plans.\na. An approved alternative compliance concept plan shall expire if three years pass following its approval and no building permit that\nimplements the concept plan has been issued.\nb. One, one-year extension may be issued by the Director provided that a written request has been received prior to the expiration of the\nconcept plan, and the Director has determined that no major changes in the city's development standards, or changes in the development\npattern of the surrounding properties, have occurred.\n5. Effect of Approval. Written approval of an alternative compliance concept plan does not authorize any development activity, but rather authorizes\nthe applicant to prepare a site plan and/or building permit application that incorporates the approved alternative compliance, and authorizes the\ndecision-making body (either the Land Use Commission or the Director for site plans, and the building official for building permits) to review the\nabout:blank 259/690\n12/4/25, 4:54 PM Austin, TX Land Development Code\nsite plan and/or building permit application for compliance with the alternative compliance concept plan, in addition to all other applicable requirements. The site\nplan and/or building permit application shall include a copy of the approved alternative compliance concept plan.\n6. Amendments to Alternative Compliance Concept Plans.\na. Minor amendments to any approved alternative compliance concept plan may be approved, approved with conditions, or denied\nadministratively by the Director. For purposes of this provision, minor amendments are those that do not result in:\n(i) An increase of 10 percent or more in the amount of square footage of a land use or structure;\n(ii) A change in the types of uses in the project;\n(iii) An increase or decrease of 20 percent or more in the number of dwelling units in the project; or\n(iv) A change that would bring the project out of compliance with any requirement or regulation set forth in the City Code outside this\nSubchapter unless a variance to or waiver from such requirement or regulation is obtained.\nb. Amendments that are not determined by the Director to be minor amendments under subsection a. above shall be deemed major\namendments. The applicant may seek approval of a major amendment by re-submitting the original approved plan along with the proposed\namendment to the Director for review in the same manner prescribed in subsection B.2. above.\nc. If any site plan and/or building permit application includes a major amendment from the terms of the approved concept plan that has not\nbeen approved by the Director, the concept plan shall be void and the application shall be reviewed for compliance with the standards of this\nSubchapter and all other applicable requirements.\n1.5.4. Criteria.\nAlternative equivalent compliance may be approved only if the applicant demonstrates that the following criteria have been met:\nA. The proposed alternative achieves the intent of the subject Article of this Subchapter from which the alternative is sought; or\nB. The proposed alternative achieves the intent of the subject Article of this Subchapter from which the alternative is sought to the maximum extent\npracticable and is necessary because:\n1. Physical characteristics unique to the subject site (such as, but not limited to, slopes, size, shape, and vegetation) make strict compliance with the\nsubject standard impracticable or unreasonable;\n2. Physical design characteristics unique to the proposed use or type of use make strict compliance with the subject standard impracticable or\nunreasonable; or\n3. An undue financial hardship would be created for a development less than 10,000 square feet without any exterior trademark design feature.\n1.5.5. Effect of Approval.\nAlternative compliance shall apply only to the specific site for which it is requested and shall not establish a precedent for approval of other requests.\nSource: Ord. 20060831-068; Ord. 20130606-088.",

In this Subchapter, roadway types are used as an organizing tool for certain development standards. In this Section 2.2., sidewalk, building\nplacement, and streetscape standards and building entryway location are determined by the roadway type that is adjacent to the site. The following\nfive roadway types are listed from highest to lowest priority for purposes of this Subchapter (See Figures 3 - 5 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord.\n20130606-088):\n1. Core Transit Corridor;\n2. Internal Circulation Route;\n3. Urban Roadway;\n4. Suburban Roadway; and\n5. Highway or Hill Country Roadway.\nB. Applicability. The roadway with the highest level of priority adjacent to the lot or site is considered the \"principal street\" for purposes of this\nSubchapter. For a lot or site that is adjacent to more than one roadway of equal priority, the development shall be subject to the standards associated\nwith the roadway with the highest level of transit service, as determined by the Director, or if the roadways do not have transit service or the level of\ntransit service is equal, the roadway designated by the lot owner.\nFor large sites subject to Section 2.2.5. or for sites abutting more than one roadway type, the Sidewalk and Supplemental Zone requirements (but not\nthe Building Placement and Parking requirements) shall apply along all abutting streets or Internal Circulation Route frontages, with the applicable\nrequirements determined by the roadway type.\n2.2.2. Core Transit Corridors: Sidewalks and Building Placement.\nA. Applicability. The following table summarizes the applicability of this section:\nStandard Applies if the Principal Street Is: Applies to the Following:\nabout:blank 261/690\n12/4/25, 4:54 PM Austin, TX Land Development Code\n2.2.2. Core Transit Corridors: Sidewalks and Core Transit Corridor - All zoning districts\nBuilding Placement - Single-family residential uses are exempt, in\naddition to the general exemptions in Section\n1.2.4.\n(See Figure 3 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Example of a Core Transit Corridor (South Congress)\n(See Figure 4 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Example of an Internal Circulation Route (Midtown Commons)\n(See Figure 5 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Example of Highway (1-35)\nB. Sidewalks. In order to create an environment that is supportive of pedestrian and transit mobility, public sidewalks shall be located along both sides\nof all Core Transit Corridors in accordance with the requirements of this section. Compliance with this section is required for all sites with frontage\nalong a Core Transit Corridor regardless of principal street designation or building placement requirements, but a development located on one side of\na street or right-of-way is not required to provide sidewalks on the opposite side of the street or right-of-way. A development that complies with the\nGreat Streets standards adopted by Resolution No. 040205-14, as now or hereafter amended, is exempt from the requirements of this section and\nmay seek any reimbursements available under the Great Streets Development program.\nFor development that is subject to the requirements of this section, no sidewalk shall be less than 15 feet in width, unless otherwise approved as part\nof the Alternative Equivalent Compliance process. The 15-foot minimum requirement shall apply regardless of the available right-of-way. Where\nrequired, the sidewalk shall extend onto private property to fulfill the 15-foot minimum requirement, with a sidewalk easement provided.\nSidewalks shall consist of two zones: a planting zone located adjacent to the curb, and a clear zone. (See Figures 6 - 9.) The following standards shall\napply to these zones:\n(See Figure 6 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Core transit corridor sidewalk requirements. Street trees are required along core transit\ncorridors with an average spacing not greater than 30 feet on center.)\n(See Figure 7 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Core transit corridor with underground utilities)\n(See Figure 8 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Core transit corridor with overhead utility zone)\n(See Figure 9 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Core transit corridor with overhead utility zone at curb)\n1. Planting Zone.\na. The planting zone shall have a minimum width of eight feet (from face of curb) and shall be continuous and located adjacent to the curb.\nb. The zone shall be planted with street trees at an average spacing not greater than 30 feet on center. The director shall adopt a list of\nacceptable street trees for purposes of this section. The list shall emphasize shade trees; however, alternative trees may only be approved\n(pursuant to Section 2.2.2.B.3. below) where conflicts may arise because of overhead utility lines.\nc. In addition, the zone is intended for the placement of street furniture including seating, street lights, waste receptacles, fire hydrants, traffic\nsigns, newspaper vending boxes, bus shelters, bicycle racks, public utility equipment such as electric transformers and water meters, and\nsimilar elements in a manner that does not obstruct pedestrian access or motorist visibility.\n2. Clear Zone. The clear zone shall be a minimum width of seven feet, shall be hardscaped, shall be located adjacent to the planting zone, and shall\ncomply with ADA and Texas Accessibility Standards. The clear zone shall be unobstructed by any permanent or nonpermanent element for a\nminimum width of seven feet and a minimum height of eight feet.\n3. Utilities.\na. All utility lines shall be underground from the building to the property line. Utility lines within the right-of-way shall be placed underground or\nrelocated to the rear of the site to the maximum extent practicable.\nb. Where electric utilities remain overhead and are located behind the curb, an overhead utility zone shall be provided so that no portion of the\nbuilding is located within a 10-foot radius of the energized conductor. This overhead utility zone shall be in addition to the minimum planting\nzone, clear zone, and supplemental zone (if provided). Options for street tree planting and sidewalk placement in combination with overhead\nutilities are illustrated in Figures 8 and 9.\n(See Figures 8 and 9 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088)\nc. On lots with a depth of 120 feet or less and where electric utilities remain overhead and are located behind the curb, alternative trees from\nthe list identified in Section 2.2.2.B.1.b. above may be used so that the trees can be located beneath, rather than offset from, the overhead\nelectric utilities.\n4. Alternative Requirements For Shallow Lots. On lots with a depth of 150 feet or less, the total sidewalk may be reduced to 12 feet, consisting of a\nseven-foot minimum planting zone and a five-foot clear zone.\nabout:blank 262/690\n12/4/25, 4:54 PM Austin, TX Land Development Code\nC. Supplemental Zone (Optional). A supplemental zone may be provided at the option of the applicant between the street-facing fa\u00e7ade line and the\nrequired clear zone. (See Figures 10 - 11.) The following standards apply to supplemental zones:\n(See Figures 10 and 11 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Optional supplemental zone may be expanded to 30 feet for a maximum\nof 30 percent of the frontage.)\n1. If a supplemental zone is provided, up to 30 percent of the linear frontage of the supplemental zone may be a maximum of 30 feet wide, and the\nremainder of the supplemental zone shall be a maximum of 20 feet wide. (See Figures 10 - 11.)\n2. Elements that support active public uses can and should be located Within the supplemental zone, including one or more of the following:\na. Accessory outdoor dining, provided that the dining area may be separated from the sidewalk only with planters, shrubs, or fencing with a\nmaximum height of 42 inches (See Figure 12.);\n(See Figure 12 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Example of supplemental zone with outdoor dining.)\nb. Balconies, pedestrian walkways, porches, handicap ramps, and stoops; provided, however, that no such feature shall extend beyond the\nsupplemental zone without a license agreement;\nc. Terraces, provided that they have a maximum finished floor height of 24 inches above the sidewalk elevation and shall be surrounded by a\nguardrail that meets city specifications;\nd. Landscape and water features;\ne. Plazas; and\nf. Incidental display and sales.\n3. Other improvements that support active uses as approved by the Director.\n4. Any features in the supplemental zone must not obstruct the open pedestrian connection between the building's primary entrance and the clear\nzone.\n5. A Transit Plaza adjacent to a Capital Metro, MetroRapid Station.\nD. Building Placement.\n1. General Building Placement Standard. Notwithstanding the minimum setback requirements of the base zoning districts, at least 75 percent of\nthe net frontage length of the property along the Core Transit Corridor must consist of continuous building fa\u00e7ade built up to the clear zone, or\nthe supplemental zone if one is provided. (See Figure 13.) For purposes of this Subchapter, \"net frontage length\" is defined in Article 5. This\nminimum net frontage length requirement shall not apply if the site qualifies for one of the exceptions in this subsection.\n(See Figure 13 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Examples of permitted building placement along Core Transit Corridors.\nParking is not permitted in the hatched area between the street-facing fa\u00e7ade and the sidewalk.)\n2. Exception: Civic Buildings. In order to provide greater flexibility to create a distinctive architectural statement, civic buildings, as defined in Article\n5, do not have to be built up to the clear zone (or supplemental zone if one is provided), so long as parking is not located between the building\nfrontage facing the principal street and the street. (See Figure 14.)\n(See Figure 14 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; The Austin City Hall is set back from the street in some areas, while other non\ncivic buildings meet the street. This is a traditional urban design technique intended to emphasize the importance of civic uses.)\n3. Exception: Pad-site Building with Drive-In or Drive-Through. A lot or site containing a drive-in or drive-through building may include a circulation\nlane of up to 20 feet in width between the building and the curb if the site has only one point of access to a public roadway. The drive-in or drive-\nthrough building located behind the circulation lane need not be built up to the clear zone, but the circulation lane may not have parking and\nmust contain an accessible and clearly marked walkway that crosses the circulation aisle and connects the clear zone to the building's principal\nentrance. (See Figure 15.)\n(See Figure 15 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Drive-through uses serviced by a single curb cut do not have to meet the\nbuilding placement standards in order to allow for a circulation lane.)\n4. Exception: Alternative Equivalent Compliance. If the applicant applies for a modification of this building placement standard through the\nalternative equivalent compliance procedure in Section 1.5 because there will not be enough building frontage to meet the 75 percent net\nfrontage length requirement, the Director may approve an alternative design provided one of the following is met, in addition to the criteria in\nSection 1.5.4.:\na. On a site with a single principal building:\n(i) The longer side of the building must be built up to the clear zone (or supplemental zone if provided) (See Figure 16.), or\n(ii) At least one side of the building must be built up to the clear zone (or supplemental zone if provided) and the majority of the tenant\nspaces must have principal entrances facing the principal street (See Figure 17.)\n(See Figures 16 and 17 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Alternative building placement options.)\nb.

    "text_content": "\u00a7 2.7. - PRIVATE COMMON OPEN SPACE AND PEDESTRIAN AMENITIES.\n2.7.1. Purpose.\nOpen air and semi-enclosed public gathering spaces can act as central organizing elements in a large development. They can also help to shape the relationship\nbetween different land uses and provide focal points and anchors for pedestrian activity. Goals and requirements for common open space and pedestrian amenities\ncomplement the Austin Code's requirements for dedicated public open space and parks, and serve similar purposes.\n2.7.2. Applicability.\nThe following table summarizes the applicability of this section:\nStandard Applies if the Principal Street Is: Applies to the Following:\n2.7. Private Common Open Space and All roadway types All site plans two acres in size or larger, and\nPedestrian Amenities all multifamily and condominium uses except\nas provided in 25-2-776 and 25-2-780\n2.7.3. Standards.\nA. Amenity Required. All development subject to this section shall devote a minimum of five percent of the gross site area to one or more of the\nfollowing types of private common open space or pedestrian amenities:\n1. A natural and undeveloped private common open space, for use of the residents, employees, and visitors to the development.\n2. A landscape area other than one required by Subchapter C, Article 9 (Landscaping), provided such landscaped area has a minimum depth and\nwidth of 20 feet and a minimum total area of 650 square feet. The area shall include pedestrian amenities.\n3. A patio or plaza with outdoor seating areas, provided the patio or plaza has a minimum depth and width of 20 feet and a minimum total area of\n650 square feet. The area shall include pedestrian amenities including fully or partially shaded spaces with flexible or permanent seating to\nsupport these places as gathering areas.\n4. A play area with amenities or equipment suitable for children under nine years of age, provided the play area has a minimum depth and width of\n20 feet and a minimum total area of 650 square feet. Play areas shall comply with the most current Consumer Product Safety Commission\nguidelines for playgrounds as well as ASTM International standards as applicable and shall have impediments between the activity area and any\nnearby vehicular drives or parking areas to minimize the opportunities for young children to wander into traffic. Such impediments may include\nberms, fencing, landscaping or other barriers as appropriate to the site and which meet safety standards. Play areas shall include partially-shaded\nareas with flexible or permanent seating for adult supervision. A project which chooses this option may reduce the total amount of open space\nrequired by 10 percent.\n5. Spaces that provide educational, historic, or cultural features, or sensory experiences, such as culinary, therapeutic or sculptural gardens;\nsoundscapes, and interactive water features.\n6. Swimming pools, wading pools, or splash pads.\n7. Water quality and storm water detention ponds designed as an amenity and approved by the Director.\n8. A multi-use trail connecting to or proposed in the City of Austin Trails Master Plan, Austin Parks and Recreation Long-Range Plan, Sidewalk Master\nPlan, or Bicycle Plan, or other trail connections as approved by the Director.\n9. Basketball, tennis, volleyball, or other sport courts or playing fields.\n10. A transit plaza, on private property, that is adjacent to a Capital Metro MetroRapid stop or station.\n11. A combination of the above-listed amenities. (See Figure 36.)\n(See Figure 36 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Examples of open space amenities.)\nabout:blank 272/690\n12/4/25, 4:54 PM Austin, TX Land Development Code\nB. Location Criteria. To the maximum extent feasible, where significant natural and scenic resource assets exist on a property, the developer shall give\npriority to their preservation as private common open space. In reviewing the proposed location of private common open space areas, the Director\nshall use all applicable plans, maps, and reports to determine whether significant resources exist on a proposed site that should be protected, with\npriority being given to the following areas (which are not listed in a particular order):\n1. Wetlands;\n2. Flood hazard areas;\n3. Lakes, rivers, and stream/riparian corridors;\n4. Tree preservation areas (See Figure 37.);\n(See Figure 37 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Example of tree preservation during construction.)\n5. Karst areas;\n6. Cultural or historically significant structures, landscapes, features, and/or places; and\n7. Agricultural lands used for cultivation of local produce.\nWhere private common open space areas, trails, parks, or other public spaces exist or are proposed in the City of Austin Trails Master Plan, Austin\nParks and Recreation Long-Range Plan, Sidewalk Master Plan, or Bicycle Plan within or adjacent to the tract to be subdivided or developed, the private\ncommon open space or pedestrian amenity shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be located to adjoin, extend, and enlarge the presently existing or\nproposed trail, park, or other open area land. Public access easements may be required in order to guarantee public access to these facilities.\nWhere there is a BRT station adjacent to the tract to be developed, a portion of the private common open space or pedestrian amenity shall, to the\nmaximum extent feasible, be located to adjoin, extend, and enlarge the presently existing or permitted station. For sites greater than one acre, the\nopen space should be a minimum of 150 s.f. plus an additional 100 s.f. per acre over one, not to exceed 1,000 s.f. This will apply only outside the\nCentral Business District (CBD) and downtown-mixed-use (DMU) zoning.\nC. Areas Not Credited. Lands within the following areas shall not be counted towards private common open space or pedestrian amenities required by\nthis section:\n1. Open space in a required street yard;\n2. Public or private streets or rights of way;\n3. Off-street parking, loading areas, driveways, and service areas; and\n4. Water quality and storm water detention ponds, unless designed as an accessible amenity and approved by the Director.\nD. Design Criteria. Land set aside for private common open space or pedestrian amenities pursuant to this section shall meet the following design\ncriteria, as relevant:\n1. Common open space areas shall be located so as to be readily accessible and useable by residents or visitors in various locations of the\ndevelopment, unless the lands are sensitive natural resources and access should be restricted.\n2. Open space areas shall be compact and contiguous unless the open space is used as a continuation of an existing trail, or specific or unique\ntopographic features that are adjacent or adjoining require a different configuration. An example of such topographic features would be the\nprovision of a trail or private open area along a riparian corridor.\n3. The surface of a required open space must be suitable for outdoor activities. A surface must consist of lawn, garden, flagstone, wood planking,\nconcrete, or other serviceable, dust free material. Asphalt or similar surfacing may be used for designated recreation areas such as multi-purpose\ntrails, tennis courts, and basketball courts. Decomposed granite may be used if approved by the Director and if accessibility requirements are\nmet. A combination of different materials is encouraged.\n4. Except as provided in this subsection, not more than 30 percent of the required open space may be located on a roof, balcony, or other area\nabove ground level. In determining the amount of open space on a roof, an area occupied by a vent, mechanical equipment or structure that does\nnot enhance the usability of the space is excluded.\n5. Up to 50 percent of the required private common open space may be located on a roof, balcony, or other area above ground level if at least 50\npercent of the open space above ground level is designed as a Vegetated or Green Roof. For the purpose of this section, a Vegetated or Green\nRoof is an assembly or system, over an occupied space, that supports an area of planted bed(s), built up on a waterproofed surface at any level\nthat is contained separately from the natural ground by a human-made structure. A Vegetated or Green Roof must comply with the performance\nstandards adopted by rule.\n6. Private common open space on a roof, balcony, or other area above ground level must be screened from the view of adjacent property that is in\nan urban residence (SF-5) or more restrictive zoning district, in accordance with the standards in Section 25-2-1066 (Screening Requirements).\n7. A project which allows public access during normal business hours to a private common open space above ground level may reduce the total\namount of open space required by 10 percent.\n8. This subsection provides for the covering of a required open space.\n(a.)\nabout:blank 273/690\n12/4/25, 4:54 PM Austin, TX Land Development Code\nNot more than 50 percent of ground level open space may be covered by a fixed manmade obstruction, including a roof, balcony, or building projection. Roof\ngardens and sculptural elements that are accessible to the public are not to be considered manmade obstructions.\n(b.) Open space above ground level may be covered, but must have at least one exterior side open and unobstructed, except for railings or\nbalustrades.\n9. In VMU and V zoning districts, streetscape improvements within the public right-of-way may be included in the calculation of open space except\nfor the area within the Clear Zone as defined in this Subchapter. This provision does not apply to streetscape projects for which the City\nparticipates in the cost of the improvements or which are required to be constructed as a condition of CURE zoning.\nE. Maintenance. All private common open space or pedestrian amenity areas shall be permanently maintained by the owners of the development.\nF. Fee In Lieu.\n1. Instead of providing private common open space or pedestrian amenities as required in this section, the developer of a property located within\nthe urban roadways boundary (as defined in Article 5 of this Subchapter) may request approval to deposit with the city a nonrefundable cash\npayment to be used for the acquisition or improvement of open space that will serve residents of the development.\n2. The criteria for approving payment of a fee and the formula for calculating the fee amount shall be adopted by the city council, with a\nrecommendation from the Director.\n3. The Director shall review a request for payment of a fee based on the adopted criteria and accept or deny the request no later than 15 days\nfollowing its receipt.\nSource: Ord. 20060831-068; Ord. 20111215-096; Ord. 20130606-088.",

The mixed use provisions define the uses of land and the siting and character of\nthe improvements and structures allowed on the land in a manner that encourages a balanced and sustainable mix of uses. They promote an efficient pedestrian-\naccess network that connects the nonresidential and residential uses and transit facilities. Redevelopment of underutilized parcels and infill development of vacant\nparcels should foster pedestrian-oriented residential and mixed use development. (See Figure 45.)\n(See Figure 45 set forth in Exhibit A attached to Ord. 20130606-088; Examples of vertical mixed use)\nCOMMENTARY: MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT IN AUSTIN GENERALLY\nThe City of Austin allows and encourages the development of mixed use projects. Mixed use development integrates two or more land uses,\nsuch as residential and commercial, with a strong pedestrian orientation. Requirements and standards for mixed use development appear in\nvarious places throughout the Austin City Code.\nZoning Districts in which Mixed Use is Allowed and Encouraged\nThe following districts are intended primarily for mixed use development and are described more fully in Section 4.2 below:\n\u2022 Mixed Use Combining District (Section 4.2.1.).\n\u2022 Vertical Mixed Use Overlay District (Section 4.2.2.).\nMixed use development also is allowed in other Austin zoning districts. Some of these districts are listed below and are described more fully in\nthe referenced sections of the Austin Code. This list is not exhaustive, but rather is intended to illustrate the range of districts in which mixed\nuse development is allowed.\n\u2022 Central Business (CBD) (Section 25-2-100);\nabout:blank 279/690\n12/4/25, 4:54 PM Austin, TX Land Development Code\n\u2022 Central Urban Redevelopment (CURE) (Section 25-2-163);\n\u2022 Downtown Mixed Use (DMU) (Section 25-2-101);\n\u2022 Planned Development Area (PDA) (Section 25-2-174);\n\u2022 Planned Unit Development (Section 25-2-144);\n\u2022 Traditional Neighborhood Development (Section 25-2-146);\n\u2022 Transit Oriented Development (Section 25-2-147);\n\u2022 Waterfront Overlay (WO) (Section 25-2-175); and\n\u2022 University Neighborhood Overlay (UNO) (Section 25-2-178).\nTypes of Mixed Use Development\nWithin the districts that allow mixed use development, uses may be combined either vertically in the same building, or horizontally in multiple\nbuildings, or through a combination of the two, depending on the standards of the district.\nVertical mixed use is allowed in two building types: the Vertical Mixed Use (VMU) Building and the Neighborhood Mixed Use (NMU) Building.\nStandards for VMU buildings are in Section 4.3. below, and standards for NMU buildings are in Subchapter D, Article 6.\nHorizontal mixed use is the mixing of uses in a development project, though not necessarily in the same building. Horizontal mixed use is\nallowed and encouraged in Austin so long as each of the proposed uses is allowed within the applicable zoning district and the development\nmeets all applicable requirements of the Austin Code.\nSource: Ord. 20060831-068; Ord. 20130606-088.",

The queuing requirements of Chapter 25-6, Appendix A, shall be reduced by 50 percent for each drive-through service in the development, so long\nas sufficient on-site queuing space exists to ensure queuing does not occur within the public right-of-way.\n2. The number of connectivity options needed to comply with Section 2.3.1.B.2. of this Subchapter shall be reduced by two for each 100 lineal feet of\nVMU buildings.\n3. All buildings in the development may aggregate points for building design in Section 3.3 of this Subchapter, rather than each building needing the\nminimum number of points.\n4. Except for in the Barton Springs Zone or the Waterfront Overlay combining district, impervious cover existing as of the effective date of this\nSubchapter may be retained for redevelopment purposes for VMU buildings no taller than 60 feet and their accompanying structured parking, so\nlong as the redevelopment meets current water quality standards and, for projects in the Drinking Water Protection Zone, the redevelopment\nincorporates the following measures to provide additional water quality benefits, pursuant to administrative rules to be developed by the director:\na. Rainwater collection and reuse;\nb. Pervious pavement;\nc. Integrated pest management; and\nd. Native and adapted landscaping.\nB. Expedited Review for Residential Permit Parking Districts. Neighborhoods that do not opt out of the VMU overlay district pursuant to the process\nestablished in Section 4.3.5. shall receive expedited review of applications to establish Residential Permit Parking (RPP) districts, for blocks starting\nwithin 600 feet of the portion of the Core Transit Corridor or Future Core Transit Corridor within the VMU overlay.

Individual Neighborhood Consideration of VMU Requirements (\"Opt-in/Opt-out Process\").\nA. Purpose. The purpose of this subsection is to establish a one-time process, which will begin following the adoption of this Subchapter, whereby\nindividual neighborhoods may consider certain development characteristics of VMU buildings within their boundaries and communicate their\npreferences to the City Council. No property is eligible for an exemption from the dimensional standards (of Section 4.3.3.E.2.) or for the additional\nground-floor uses otherwise authorized by Section 4.3.3.C.2. until the conclusion of the opt-in and opt-out processes described in this section.\nB. Procedure.\n1. Initiation. Upon the adoption date of this Subchapter, the Director shall identify neighborhood areas and notify each neighborhood planning\nteam that the VMU neighborhood consideration process shall be initiated. If there is no neighborhood planning team, the applicable\nneighborhood associations in a neighborhood shall work together to develop an opt-in/opt-out application for the purposes of this section.\n2. Application. Each neighborhood planning team or neighborhood association shall review the VMU standards in Section 4.3.3. The planning team\nor applicable neighborhood association may, no later than 90 days after receiving written notice from the Director of this Subchapter's adoption,\nsubmit an opt-in/optout application to the City Manager concerning any of the items listed in subsection C. below. The planning team or\nneighborhood association may amend a timely filed application not later than August 9, 2007.\n3. Planning Commission Recommendation. The City Manager shall forward any opt-in/opt-out applications received to the Planning Commission,\nwhich shall review and make recommendations on all such applications to the City Council.\n4. City Council Decision. After considering the Planning Commission's recommendations, the Council may by ordinance approve, approve with\nconditions, or deny each opt-in/optout request. The Council may concurrently amend the appropriate neighborhood plan. The neighborhood plan\namendment process does not apply to the amendment.\n5. Effect of Approval. Following completion of this one-time opt-in/opt-out process:\na. The director shall indicate on the zoning map with map code \"V\" each property receiving an exemption from the dimensional standards under\nSection 4.3.3.E.2, additional ground floor commercial uses under Section 4.3.3.C.2, or a reduction in the median family income for affordable\nrental housing under Section 4.3.3.F.2.b. The \"V\" shall include properties receiving the exemption under Section 4.3.5.B.4. pursuant to Council\naction on an opt-out application, or under Section 4.3.5.C.l.b. if no application has been filed.\nabout:blank 285/690\n12/4/25, 4:54 PM Austin, TX Land Development Code\nb. Any subsequent amendments to the VMU standards in a neighborhood shall require amendment of the applicable neighborhood plan and\nneighborhood plan combining district.\nc. Any property owner or neighborhood association may submit an application to change the VMU rules on a specific property or properties by\namending the applicable neighborhood plan and neighborhood plan combining district to opt-in to the exemption from the dimensional\nstandards of Section 4.3.3.E.2 and/or the additional ground-floor uses identified by Section 4.3.3.C.2.\nd. Any property owner may file a zoning application for Vertical Mixed Use (V) or Mixed Use (MU) combining district, regardless of whether a\nneighborhood plan combining district has been adopted.\nC. Types of Opt-in/Opt-Out Applications. Only the following types of opt-in/opt-out applications may be submitted:\n1. VMU Overlay District: Opt-out.\na. A neighborhood with properties in the VMU overlay district may request that the neighborhood \"opt-out\" of the dimensional standards\nexemption in Section 4.3.3.E.2., and/or the ground-floor commercial uses allowed in Section 4.3.3.C.2. for some or all of the properties within\nthe VMU overlay district. If such an opt-out application is submitted and approved, the applicable standards shall not apply to affected VMU\nbuildings within that neighborhood; instead, such buildings shall be required to comply with all dimensional and/or use standards applicable\nto the base zoning district. Such buildings also shall comply with the applicable minimum site area requirements in the MU combining district;\nsee Section 4.2.1.D.6.\nb. If no opt-out application is submitted on a property, or an opt-out application is submitted and denied, the dimensional standard exemption\nin Section 4.3.3.E.2. and the ground-floor commercial use provisions in Section 4.3.3.C.2. shall apply to all VMU buildings on that property.\n2. MU-Designated Properties: Opt-in.\na. A neighborhood with properties with the MU zoning designation may request to \"opt-in\" to the dimensional standards exemption in Section\n4.3.3.E.2., and/or the ground floor commercial uses allowed in Section 4.3.3.C.2. for some or all of the properties with the MU zoning\ndesignation. If such an opt-in application is submitted and approved, the dimensional and/or use standards shall apply to VMU buildings on\nsites with the MU zoning designation within the applicable neighborhood boundaries.\nb. If no opt-in application is submitted for a property, or an opt-in application is submitted and denied, VMU buildings on a property designated\nMU shall comply with all dimensional and use standards applicable to the base zoning district and the MU combining district.\n3. Properties Not in VMU Overlay District and without MU Designation: Opt-in to VMU. Any neighborhood that desires to allow VMU buildings\nwithin its boundaries on commercially zoned properties that are not otherwise eligible for VMU buildings under this Subchapter may submit an\n\"opt-in\" application to allow such development. The application shall specify the properties on which the neighborhood wishes to allow VMU\nbuildings, whether the ground-floor commercial listed in Section 4.3.3.C.2. should be allowed, and whether the dimensional standards exemption\nof Section 4.3.3.E.2. should apply.\n4. All Properties that Allow VMU Buildings: Affordability Standards. Also as part of the opt-in/opt-out process, for each neighborhood in which\nVMU buildings are allowed, the neighborhood association or neighborhood planning team may request that the affordable rental units be\navailable for renters earning a lower percentage of the area median family income, to as low as 60 percent of the median family income, pursuant\nto Section 4.3.3.F.2.b.\n5. VMU Overlay District: Residential Opt-in. A neighbor-hood that desires to allow VMU buildings within its boundaries on property in a VMU\noverlay district that is used exclusively for residential use and that is not designated as a MU combining district may submit an application to allow\nthe development. The application shall specify the properties on which the neighborhood wishes to allow VMU buildings, whether ground-floor\ncommercial listed in Section 4.3.3.C.2 should be allowed, and whether the dimensional standards of Section 4.3.3.E.2 should apply.\n6. Removal from the VMU Overlay District. A neighborhood may request that the Council amend the boundaries of the VMU overlay district to\nremove a property from the overlay district.\nSource: Ord. 20060831-068; Ord. 20070215-071; Ord. 20070621-027; Ord. 20070726-133; Ord. 20071129-098; Ord. 20090611-074; Ord. 20100408-049; Ord.\n20130606-088; Ord.

Average Front Yard Setback. The following rules apply for purposes of the setback calculation required by Paragraph A.2:\n1. A front yard setback is the distance between the front lot line and the closest front exterior wall or building fa\u00e7ade of the principal residential\nstructure located on the lot.\n2. Except as provided in paragraph 3, average front yard setback is determined using the front yard setback of the four principal residential structures\nthat are: (a) built within fifty feet of the front lot line; and (b) closest to, and on the same side of the block, as the property subject to the setback\nrequired by this section.\n3. If less than four structures satisfy the criteria in paragraph B.2, average front yard setback is calculated using the number of existing residential\nstructures on the same side of the street block as the property subject to the setback required by this section. If there are no structures on the same\nside of the block, average front yard setback is calculated using the front yard setbacks of the four structures on the opposite side of the block that\nare closest to the property subject to the setback required by this section.

A structure may not extend beyond a setback plane except as authorized by subsection D. below. The height of a setback plane shall be\nmeasured under the requirements defined in Section 3.4.\nA. Side Setback Plane. Except as provided in subsection B. below, an inwardly sloping 45-degree angle side setback plane begins at a horizontal line 15 feet\ndirectly above the side property line. The 15-foot height of the horizontal line is established for 40-foot deep portions of the lot beginning at the building\nline and extending to the rear of the lot, except that the last portion at the rear of the lot may be less than 40 feet deep. See Figures 3 through 5.\n1. For the first portion, the 15-foot height of the horizontal line is measured at the highest of the elevations of the four intersections of the side lot lines,\nthe building line, and a line 40 feet from and parallel to the building line.\n2. For successive portions other than the last portion, the 15-foot height of the horizontal line is measured at the highest of the elevations of the four\nintersections of the side lot lines and the appropriate two lines that are 40 feet apart and parallel to the building line.\n3. For the last portion, the 15-foot height of the horizontal line is measured at the highest of the elevations of the four intersections of the side lot lines,\nthe appropriate line parallel to the building line, and the rear lot line.\nFigure 3: Side Setback Plane Measured From Side Property Line\nabout:blank 295/690\n12/4/25, 4:54 PM Austin, TX Land Development Code\nFigure 4: (Elevation View) Dividing Lot into 40-foot Portions to Create Side Setback Planes (Rear Setback Plane Not Shown)\nFigure 5: Determining High Points on a Sloping Lot\nFor each portion of the side setback plane, the 15-foot height of the horizontal line is measured starting from the highest point of the four intersections\ndefining the portion. In this example, topography lines indicate that the lot is sloping downward from the rear to the front of the lot, and from the right to\nthe left. The high points for Portions 1, 2, and 3 are indicated, along with the Building Line.\nB. Rear Setback Plane. Except as provided in subsection D., an inwardly sloping 45-degree angle rear setback plane begins at a horizontal line directly above\nthe rear property line at the same elevation as the horizontal line for the last portion of the side setback plane established in paragraph A.3.

In this example, the\nminimum required street side yard setback in the underlying zoning district is 15 feet. Because the side setback plane is measured from the side property\nline, the height of the setback plane is 30 feet at the 15-foot street side yard setback line.\nD. Side and Rear Setback Plane Exceptions for Existing One-Story Buildings.\n1. Except as provided in paragraph 3 below, an applicant proposing to add a second story to a one-story building may choose either of the following side\nsetback planes for the portion of the project that is within the building footprint originally constructed, or permitted for original construction, before\nOctober 1, 2006:\na. The side setback plane required under subsection A.\nb. The inwardly sloping 45-degree angle side setback plane that begins at a horizontal line directly above the outermost side wall at a height equal to\nthe height of the first floor wall plate that was originally constructed or received a building permit before October 1, 2006, plus 10 and one-half\nfeet. See Figure 12. The wall plate is the lowest point of the existing first floor ceiling framing that intersects the exterior wall.\n2. Except as provided in paragraph 3 below, an applicant proposing to add a second story to a one-story building may choose either of the following rear\nsetback planes for the portion of the project that is within the building footprint originally constructed, or permitted for original construction, before\nOctober 1, 2006:\na. The rear setback plane required under subsection B.\nb. An inwardly sloping 45-degree angle rear setback plane that begins at a horizontal line directly above the rear property line at a height equal to\nthe height of the first floor wall plate that was originally constructed or received a building permit before October 1, 2006, plus 10 and one-half\nfeet.\n3. The side setback plane required under subsection A, and the rear setback plane required under subsection B, apply to:\na. any portion of the proposed construction that is outside of the building footprint originally constructed, or permitted for original construction,\nbefore October 1, 2006; and\nb. the entire project, if any portion of the proposed construction requires the removal or demolition of exterior walls.\nFigure 12: Side Setback Plane Exception for Existing Single-Story Buildings\nThe side setback planes for an existing single-story building are determined based on the height of the sidewall. In this example, the horizontal line that\nforms the base of the setback plane is placed ten feet and six inches above the sidewall height (12 feet). The revised plane rises above the standard setback\nplane within the area of the building footprint. The standard setback planes created in Sections 2.6. A. and B. apply outside of the existing footprint.\nE. Exceptions. A structure may not extend beyond a setback plane, except for:\n1. A roof overhang or eave, up to two feet beyond the setback plane;\n2. A chimney, vent, antenna, or energy conservation or production equipment or feature not designed for occupancy; and\nabout:blank 298/690\n12/4/25, 4:54 PM Austin, TX Land Development Code\n3.

Gables Plus Dormers Exception.\n(i) Gables or a shed roof, with a total horizontal length of not more than 18 feet on each side of the building, measured along the intersection\nwith the setback plane (See Figures 14 and 17.); and\n(ii) Dormers, with a total horizontal length of not more than 15 feet on each side of the building, measured along the intersection with the\nsetback plane. (See Figures 15 and 16.)\nFigure 13: Side-Gabled Rood Exception\nA side-gabled roof may project through the side setback plane for a horizontal distance of up to a maximum of 30 feet, measured from the building line. In\nthis example, the gable intrudes into the setback plane beginning 9 feet behind the building line. Therefore, the maximum length of the gable intrusion\nwould be 21 feet.\nFigure 14: 18-foot Exception for Shed Roof\nFigure 15: Dormer Exception (Gable or Shed)\nOne or more dormers with a combined width of 15 feet or less on each side of the roof may extend beyond the setback plane.

A traditional neighborhood district diversifies and integrates land uses within close proximity to\neach other, and it provides for the daily recreational and shopping needs of the residents. A traditional neighborhood district is a sustainable, long-term\ncommunity that provides economic opportunity and environmental and social equity for the residents.\n(B) A traditional neighborhood district is designed to ensure the development of land as a traditional neighborhood. Its design adopts the urban conventions\nwhich were the norm in the United States from colonial times until the 1940's. A traditional neighborhood district is characterized by the following design\nelements:\n(1) neighborhoods that are limited in size and oriented toward pedestrian activity;\n(2) a variety of housing types, jobs, shopping, services, and public facilities;\n(3) residences, shops, workplaces, and civic buildings interwoven within the neighborhood, all within close proximity;\nabout:blank 319/690\n12/4/25, 4:54 PM Austin, TX Land Development Code\n(4) a network of interconnecting streets and blocks that maintains respect for the natural landscape;\n(5) natural features and undisturbed areas that are incorporated into the open space of the neighborhood;\n(6) a coordinated transportation system with a hierarchy of appropriately designed facilities for pedestrians, bicycles, public transit, and automotive\nvehicles;\n(7) well-configured squares, plazas, greens, landscaped streets, preserves, greenbelts, and parks woven into the pattern of the neighborhood and\ndedicated to the collective social activity, recreation, and visual enjoyment of the populace;\n(8) civic buildings, open spaces, and other visual features that act as landmarks, symbols, and focal points for community identity;\n(9) compatibility of buildings and other improvements as determined by their arrangement, bulk, form, character, and landscaping to establish a livable,\nharmonious, and diverse environment;\n(10) private buildings that form a consistent, distinct edge and define the border between the public street space and the private block interior; and\n(11) architecture and landscape that respond to the unique character of the region.\nSource: Section 13-9-2; Ord. 990225-70; Ord. 031211-11.",

    "text_content": "\u00a7 25-3-3 - OVERVIEW.\n(A) A traditional neighborhood district consists of an area of not less than 40 contiguous acres and not more than 250 contiguous acres. In this chapter,\nproperty is considered contiguous even if separated by a public roadway.\n(B) A traditional neighborhood district is divided into at least two types of Areas, and each type of Area has different land use and site development\nregulations. A traditional neighborhood district must have one Neighborhood Center Area and at least one Mixed Residential Area. A traditional\nneighborhood district may also have a Neighborhood Edge Area, a Workshop Area, or an Employment Center Area.\n(C) A Neighborhood Center Area serves as the focal point of a traditional neighborhood district, containing retail, commercial, civic, and public services to\nmeet the daily needs of community residents. A Neighborhood Center is pedestrian-oriented, and it is designed to encourage pedestrian movement\nbetween a Mixed Residential Area and a Neighborhood Center Area. A square is required in a Neighborhood Center Area. Retail and commercial uses\nshould generally be located adjacent to a square. Neighborhood Center Area uses include retail shops, restaurants, offices, banks, hotels, post office,\ngovernmental offices, churches, community centers, and attached residential dwellings.\n(D) A Mixed Residential Area includes a variety of residential land uses including single-family residential, duplex, townhouse, and multi-family. Residential\nscale retail and commercial uses are permitted within a Mixed Residential area with strict architectural and land use controls. Retail and commercial uses\nin a Mixed Residential area are required to blend into the residential character of the neighborhood. A Mixed Residential area includes open spaces\nincluding small squares, pocket parks, community parks, and greenbelts. A Mixed Residential Area promotes pedestrian activity through well designed\nand varied streetscapes that also provide for the safe and efficient movement of vehicular traffic. Mixed Residential Area uses include single-family\nhomes, condominiums, townhouses, apartments, offices, restaurants, neighborhood scale retail, and civic uses.\n(E) A Neighborhood Edge Area is the least dense portion of a traditional neighborhood district, with larger lots and greater setbacks than the rest of the\nneighborhood. Alleys are not required, and direct vehicular access to the street is permitted. Only single family residential dwellings are permitted. A\nNeighborhood Edge Area is appropriate along the perimeter of the neighborhood. A portion of a traditional neighborhood district that adjoins existing or\nplatted conventional low density housing must be designated as a Neighborhood Edge Area.\n(F) A traditional neighborhood district may have a Workshop Area, an Employment Center Area, or both. Commercial and light industrial uses that are not\nappropriate for a Neighborhood Center Area or a Mixed Residential Area but which serve the local residents may be located in a Workshop Area. Large\noffice and low-impact manufacturing uses may be located within an Employment Center Area. The scale and architectural conventions of a traditional\nneighborhood district apply to a Workshop area and an Employment Center Area.\n(G) Civic uses that are oriented to the general public are permitted in a Neighborhood Center Area and a Mixed Residential Area. These uses are essential\ncomponents of the social and physical fabric of a traditional neighborhood district. Special attention should be paid to the location of government offices,\nlibraries, museums, schools, churches, and other prominent public buildings to create focal points and landmarks for the community. The locations of\nthese major public civic uses are designated on the Development Plan at the time of zoning approval.\n(H) Open space is a significant part of a traditional neighborhood district design. Formal and informal open spaces are required. These serve as areas for\ncommunity gatherings, landmarks, and as organizing elements for the neighborhood. Open space includes squares, plazas, greens, preserves, parks, and\ngreenbelts.\n(I) A traditional neighborhood district is designed to be pedestrian oriented. To accomplish this goal, street pattern and design is used to reduce vehicle\ntravel speeds and encourage pedestrian activity. An interconnected network of streets and alleys is required. Streets may be smaller than in conventional\ndevelopment and more varied in size and form to control traffic and give character to the neighborhood.\nSource: Section 13-9-3; Ord. 990225-70; Ord. 000309-39; Ord. 031211-11.",

For purposes of this subsection, off-street parking includes any parking that is designated to serve a use and is not located in\na public right-of-way, regardless of whether the parking is onsite or offsite.\nEditor's note\u2014Amendments to division (B) of this section made by Ord. 20130523-104 did not take into account amendments previously made by Ord. 20130411-\n061. The amendments enacted by Ord. 20130523-104 have therefore been made only to other parts of the section that do not conflict with Ord. 20130411-061.\nFuture legislation will correct the text if needed.\n(1) If off-street parking is provided, it must include parking for persons with disabilities as required by the Building Code and may not include fewer\naccessible spaces than would be required under Paragraph (2)(a) of this subsection.\n(2) Except for a use occupying a designated historic landmark or an existing building in a designated historic district, off-street motor vehicle parking for\npersons with disabilities must be provided for a use that occupies 6,000 square feet or more of floor space under the requirements of this paragraph.\n(a) The following requirements apply if no parking is provided for a use, other than parking for persons with disabilities:\n(i) the minimum number of accessible parking spaces is calculated by taking 100 percent of the parking previously required for the use under\nAppendix A (Tables of Off-Street Loading Requirements and Former Off-Street Parking Requirements) and using that result to determine the\nnumber of accessible spaces required under the Building Code. The accessible spaces may be provided on- or off-site, within 250 feet of the\nuse and must be on an accessible route.\n(ii) The director may waive or reduce the number of accessible spaces required under Paragraph (2)(a)(i) if the applicant pays a fee in-lieu to be\nused by the city to construct and maintain accessible parking in the vicinity of the use. The availability of this option is contingent on the\nestablishment of a fee by separate ordinance and the adoption of a program by the director to administer the fee and establish eligibility\ncriteria. A decision by the director that a use is ineligible for a fee in-lieu is final.\n(iii) The director may waive or reduce the number of accessible spaces required if no accessible spaces can be provided consistent with the\nrequirements of Paragraph (2)(a)(i) and the use is ineligible for participation in the fee in-lieu program under Paragraph (2)(a)(ii).\n(iv) An off-site or on-street parking space designated for persons with disabilities that is located within 250 feet of a use may be counted towards\nthe number of parking spaces the use is required to provide under Paragraph (2)(a)(i).\n(b) If any off-street parking is provided for a use, other than parking for persons with disabilities, then the use is subject to the requirements in\nParagraph (1).\n(3) Except as provided in Subsections (C) and (F), the maximum motor vehicle parking facility allowed is 60 percent of the number of motor vehicle\nparking spaces previously required by Appendix A (Tables of Off-Street Loading Requirements and Former Off-Street Parking Requirements).\n(4) Except as provided in Subsections (C) and (D) of this section, a parking garage must be separated from an adjacent street by a pedestrian-oriented use\ndescribed in Section 25-2-691 (Waterfront Overlay (WO) District Uses) that fronts on the street at the ground level.\n(5) A curb cut for a garage access must have a width of 30 feet or less.\n(6) At the intersection of sidewalk and parking access lane, ten degree cones of vision are required.\n(C) The maximum number of parking spaces allowed under Subsection (B)(3) of this section may be increased at the request of an applicant under the\nrequirements of this subsection.\n(1) The director shall approve an increase if all parking spaces are contained in a parking structure and the total number of spaces is less than 110\npercent of the spaces calculated under Appendix A (Tables of Off-Street Loading Requirements and Former Off-Street Parking Requirements).\n(2) Only if bicycle parking is also increased proportionately.\n(D) The Land Use Commission may waive the requirement of Subsection (B)(5) of this section during the site plan review process after determining that:\n(1) present and anticipated development in the area is not amenable to access by pedestrians;\n(2) the requirement does not allow a reasonable use of the property; or\n(3) other circumstances attributable to the property make compliance impractical.\n(E) If a waiver is granted under Subsection (D), an area for which the requirement is waived must be screened.\n(F) This subsection applies to property zoned CBD and DMU.\n(1) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the maximum number of motor vehicle parking spaces allowed is 40 percent of the number of motor\nvehicle parking spaces formerly required by Appendix A (Tables of Off-Street Parking and Loading Requirements).\n(2) A development that is les than 10,000 square feet in floor area or containing 70 or fewer residential units can include up to 60 percent of motor\nvehicle parking spaces formerly required by Appendix A (Tables of Off-Street Parking and Loading Requirements).\n(3) The maximum number of motor vehicle parking spaces allowed is 80 percent of the number of motor vehicle parking spaces formerly required by\nAppendix A (Tables of Off-Street Loading Requirements and Former Off-Street Parking Requirements) if:\n(a) all parking spaces are contained in a parking structure;\n(b) the director finds that allowing additional parking spaces does not impact public health, safety, or welfare or undermine established planning\npolicies for the area;

or\n(v) the applicant pays a mitigation fee established by separate ordinance.\n(4) In addition to the number of motor vehicle parking spaces allowed under Subdivision (3), the number of motor vehicle parking spaces can be\nincreased up to 20 percent of the number of spaces formerly required by Appendix A (Tables of Off-Street Loading requirements and Former Off-\nStreet Parking Requirements) for a maximum of 100 percent, if the additional parking spaces are included in an underground parking structure.\n(5) A mitigation fee collected in Subdivision (3) is to be used for multimodal improvements within the area bounded by Martin Luther King, Jr., Boulevard;\nIH-35;
